The Amazon Kinesis Storm Spout enables developers to use Amazon Kinesis with Storm, an open source, distributed real-time computation system. This update to the Spout supports Ack/Fail semantics. Specifically, the spout will now re-emit failed messages up to the customer configured retry limit. This makes it easier to build reliable data processing applications with Storm using Kinesis streams. This builds on the core functionality of the spout that fetches data from the Amazon Kinesis stream and emits it as tuples that Storm topologies can process. Developers can add the Spout to their existing Storm topologies, and leverage Amazon Kinesis as a reliable, scalable, stream capture, storage, and replay service that powers their Storm processing applications.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon Kinesis Storm Spout update with support for Ack/Fail semantics "}

When you purchase new domains via Route 53, the service will automatically configure a Hosted Zone for each domain. Route 53 offers privacy protection for your WHOIS record at no additional charge. In addition, you benefit from AWS's consolidated billing to manage your domain name expenses alongside all of your other AWS resources. Route 53 offers a selection of more than 150 top-level domains (TLDs), including the major generic TLDs like .com, .net, .org, and .info, and country TLDs including .co.uk, .de, .tv, and .com.au. Getting started with Route 53 Domain Name Registration is easy. Please see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html\">Route 53 documentation</a> for more details.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b><u>Geographic Routing with Geo DNS</u></b></p>\n<p>Route 53's Geo DNS support lets you balance load by directing requests to specific endpoints based on the geographic location from which the request originates. Geo DNS makes it possible to customize localized content, such as presenting detail pages in the right language or restricting distribution of content to only the markets you have licensed. Geo DNS also lets you balance load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, ensuring that each end-user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint. Geo DNS provides three levels of geographic granularity: continent, country, and state, and Geo DNS also provides a global record which is served in cases where an end user's location doesn't match any of the specific Geo DNS records you have created. You can also combine Geo DNS with other routing types, such as Latency Based Routing and DNS Failover, using Route 53's Alias feature in order to enable a variety of low-latency and fault-tolerant architectures  To learn more, please see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo\">Route 53 documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><b><u>Lower Prices for DNS Queries</u></b></p>\n<p>Effective August 1, we are lowering Route 53 prices for both Standard Queries and Latency Based Routing Queries by 20%. As before, queries to Alias records that are mapped to Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon S3 website buckets are free.

Previously, to update a health check you had to delete the existing health check and create a new one with the desired changes. With editable health checks, you can change the parameters of your health checks, which removes the need to update your resource record sets. You will also not lose any CloudWatch history for your health checks.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can now also use health check tagging to attach metadata to your health checks via tags. When you create a new health check, the Route 53 console allows you to enter a \"Name\" tag, and the console displays the \"Name\" tag in the list of your health checks. You can also add a \"Name\" tag to any of your existing health checks. The \"Name\" tag appears in the Route 53 console when you associate a health check with a resource record set. In addition, you can add other tags to your health checks (for example, owner, workflow, or cost center tags) that you can then use for cost allocation in your AWS billing statements.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nEditable health checks and tagging support are available today at no additional cost.

Captioning is the process of displaying text that accompanies the video to transcribe the audio portion of the program or translate the audio into a different language. Starting today you can now use Elastic Transcoder to add, remove, or preserve captions as you transcode your video from one format to another.</p>\n<p>Captioning Support helps you make your videos easily accessible to a broader set of viewers who are either hearing impaired, consuming the video in noisy environments such as train rides, or want to enjoy a video presented in a language they don’t understand. To get started with this feature, you simply include caption data with each video in your transcoding job. You may transcode embedded broadcast caption formats such as CEA-608 to newer formats such as WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) to reach modern internet enabled devices. You may also supply a separate sidecar file (a stand-alone file containing only captions) along with the original caption file to add support for a language that was not included in the original video. Finally, you may include an output DFXP caption file (which is compatible with the SMPTE-TT standard) to prepare content that complies with FCC rules that require captioning support for programs re-shown on the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are no additional costs for using Captioning Support with Amazon Elastic Transcoder beyond the normal usage fees for the service.

General Purpose (SSD) volumes are our new default Amazon EBS storage option and are suitable for a broad range of use cases, including small to medium-sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes.</p>\n<p>Backed by Solid-State Drives (SSDs), General Purpose (SSD) volumes provide the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS per volume, independent of volume size, to meet the performance needs of most applications and also deliver a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GB. General Purpose (SSD) volumes offer the same five nines of availability and durable snapshot capabilities as other volume types. Pricing and performance for General Purpose (SSD) volumes are simple and predictable. You pay for each GB of storage you provision, and there are no additional charges for I/O performed on a volume. Prices start as low as $0.10/GB.</p>\n<p>You can now choose between three Amazon EBS volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic volumes. General Purpose (SSD) volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium-sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance, are designed for I/O-intensive applications such as large relational or <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/nosql.html\">NoSQL databases</a>, and allow you to choose the level of performance you need. Magnetic volumes, formerly known as Standard volumes, provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all Amazon EBS volume types and are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to create a new General Purpose (SSD) volume with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. If you have an existing volume you would like to migrate to a General Purpose (SSD) volume, you can simply take a snapshot, and use the snapshot to create a new General Purpose (SSD) volume.</p>\n<p>To learn more please see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/\">Amazon EBS details page</a>.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Introducing the Amazon EBS General Purpose (SSD) volume type"}

With many different app stores and push services, our customers are now realizing that this is a difficult issue to solve and have asked for additional options. In order to allow app developers to address this large and rapidly growing market and to avoid having to customize their code for every app store, Amazon SNS can now deliver messages to users in China through the Baidu Cloud Push, regardless of the app store that they use.</p>\n<p><strong>Message Attributes:</strong> Message attributes allow you to provide structured metadata items (such as timestamps, geospatial data, signatures, and identifiers) about the message. Message attributes are optional and separate from, but sent along with, the message body. This information can be used by the receiver of the message to help decide how to handle the message without having to first process the message body.  You can use SNS message attributes in conjunction with SQS and mobile push endpoints.</p>\n<p>These new features are available now, and you can start using them immediately. To start sending messages today, please visit the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html\">SNS Getting Started Guide</a>.\r\n</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"SNS now has Windows support, and China Android support with Baidu"}

First, you can provision up to 3 TB in storage and up to 30,000 IOPS for your database instances (maximum realized IOPS will vary by engine type). Second, you can convert an existing <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon RDS</a> instance that uses standard storage to use Provisioned IOPS storage. Third, you can scale IOPS and storage independently. And, finally, you can now launch M3 database instances. Here are the details:</p>\n<p><b>Provision up to 3TB storage and 30,000 IOPS:</b> You can now provision up to 3TB storage and 30,000 IOPS per database instance – three times the previous limit of 1 TB and 10,000 IOPS per database instance. For a workload with 50% writes and 50% reads running on an m2.4xlarge instance, you can realize up to 25,000 IOPS with Oracle and PostgreSQL and 12,500 IOPS with MySQL. However, by provisioning up to 30,000 IOPS, you may be able to achieve lower latency and higher throughput. For SQL Server you can provision up to 10,000 IOPS and 1 TB of allocated storage. Your actual realized IOPS may vary from the amount you provisioned based on your database workload, instance type, and database engine choice. Refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.ProvisionedIOPS.html#USER_PIOPS.Realized\">Factors That Affect Realized IOPS</a> section of the documentation to learn more.</p>\n<p><b>Convert an existing database instance to use Provisioned IOPS storage:</b> You can now convert database instances using standard storage to use Provisioned IOPS storage and get consistent throughput and low I/O latencies. Use the &quot;Modify&quot; action for your database instance on the DB Instances page of the <a href=\"https://console.amazonaws-us-gov.com\">AWS Management Console</a>, check the &quot;Use Provisioned IOPS&quot; check box, specify the number of IOPS required for your workload, and proceed through the wizard. You can also perform this operation via the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/\">Amazon RDS APIs</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Command Line Interface</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Scale storage and IOPS independently:</b> You can now scale IOPS (in increments of 1000) and storage independently. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to the storage requested (in GB) should be between 3 and 10. For example, for a database instance with 1000 GB of storage, you can provision from 3,000 to 10,000 IOPS. You can scale the IOPS up or down depending on factors such as seasonal variability of traffic to your applications.</p>\n<p><b>M3 Instance Type Support:</b> These new instances provide you with a similar ratio of CPU and memory resources as our previous M1 database instances but offer 50% more computational capability/core, significantly improving overall compute capacity. Out of these new DB instances, the db.m3.xlarge and db.m3.2xlarge are optimized for Provisioned IOPS storage. For a workload with 50% writes and 50% reads running on db.m3.2xlarge instance type, it is possible to realize up to 12,500 IOPS for MySQL and 25,000 IOPS for Oracle and PostgreSQL. Refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.html\">Provisioned IOPS</a> storage section of the User Guide to learn more.</p>\n<p>You are also invited to attend the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/events/\">AWS GovCloud (US) Solutions Architect Office Hours</a> on June 3rd and the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/events/\">Introduction to AWS GovCloud (US) webinar</a> with the AWS GovCloud (US) team on June 11th, where you can learn more about the AWS GovCloud (US) region and the new RDS offerings.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon RDS in AWS GovCloud (US) now supports Provisioned IOPS and M3 Instance Types"}

With this enhancement, Amazon CloudFront now provides even better routing, hence improving performance for your end users who use Google Public DNS or Open DNS resolvers.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront automatically routes requests for your content to the optimal edge location by looking at the IP address of the resolver making the DNS query. We do this because DNS resolvers are typically a good proxy for an end user's location. However, in some cases, your end users may be using DNS resolvers that are far from their geographic location and in those cases, end user requests may be routed to an Amazon CloudFront edge location that isn’t optimal for your end user. By supporting EDNS-Client-Subnet, Amazon CloudFront can now route requests to the optimal edge location by looking at a truncated version of the end user’s IP address added into the DNS request. Today, Google Public DNS and Open DNS are two providers that include this truncated IP address (specifically, the first three octets) of the end user in the DNS request.

These new locations will improve performance and availability for end users of your applications being served by Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, and they bring the total number of AWS edge locations to 51 worldwide.</p>\n<p>These new edge locations support all Amazon CloudFront functionality, including accelerating your entire website (static, dynamic and interactive content), live and on-demand streaming media, and security features like custom SSL certificates, private content and geo-restriction of content. They also support all Amazon Route 53 functionality including health checks, DNS failover, and latency-based routing.</p>\n<p>The pricing for the edge location in Taipei is the same as that in Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Korea and Singapore, and the pricing for the edge location in Rio de Janeiro is the same as that in Sao Paulo. That means your end users in these regions will benefit from the lower latency without any additional costs. </p>\n<p>To learn more about Amazon CloudFront, please visit the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cloudfront.html\">Amazon CloudFront detail page</a>.
