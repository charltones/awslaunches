Visitors to your website can now easily and reliably access your site from their browser without specifying “www” in the web address (e.g. “example.com”). Many customers already host static websites on Amazon S3 that are accessible via a “www” subdomain (e.g. “www.example.com”). Previously, to support root domain access, you needed to run your own web server to proxy root domain requests from browsers to your website on S3. Running a web server to proxy requests introduces additional costs, operational burden, and another potential point of failure. Now, you can take advantage of S3’s high availability and durability for both “www” and root domain addresses. </p>\n<p>For more information on hosting your static website on Amazon S3 and support for hosting websites at the root domain, review our <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html\">walkthrough</a> in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.</p>","headline":"Root Domain Support on Amazon S3 Hosted Websites"}

You can perform these operations on a Read Replica, and once the operations are complete and the updates are caught up with the Source DB Instance, you can promote the Read Replica, and point your applications to it.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Sharding </b>embodies the \"share-nothing\" architecture and essentially involves breaking a larger database up into smaller databases. Common ways to split a database are: Splitting tables that are not joined in the same query onto different hosts or duplicating a table across multiple hosts and then deciding on a hashing algorithm to figure out into which host a row goes. You can create Read Replicas corresponding to each of your “shards” and promote them when you decide to convert them into “standalone” shards. You can then delete the rows or tables that belong to the other shards.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Recovery against failures</b>: Amazon RDS provides multiple options for data recovery during failures including <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstance.html#Concepts.MultiAZ\">Multi-AZ deployments</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.BackingUpUpAndRestoringAmazonRDSInstances.html#Overview.BackupUpAndRestoringAmazonRDSInstances.PIT\">Point in Time Recovery</a>. With the ability to “Promote“, Read Replica can potentially be considered as an additional recovery alternative against failures. However, it is to be noted that with asynchronous replication, database writes occur on a Read Replica after they have already occurred on the Source DB Instance, and this replication “lag” can vary significantly depending on the workload. If your use case requires synchronous replication, automatic failure detection and failover, we recommend you run your DB Instance as a <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/RDSFAQ.MultiAZ.html\">Multi-AZ deployment</a>. </li>\n<p>Please refer to the Read Replicas section of the <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.ReadReplica.html\">User Guide</a> to learn more.</p>\n  </ul>","headline":"Amazon RDS for MySQL Now Supports Read Replica Promotion"}

Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server database in the cloud – and now enables you to provision up to 10,000 IOPS (input/output operations per second) with 1TB of storage for your new database instances.</p>\n<p>Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS is optimized for I/O-intensive, transactional (OLTP) database workloads. We are delivering this functionality to you in two stages. Starting immediately, when you create new database instances using the AWS Management Console or the Amazon RDS APIs, you can provision from 1,000 IOPS to 10,000 IOPS with corresponding storage from 100GB to 1TB for MySQL and Oracle databases. If you are using SQL Server then the maximum IOPS you can provision is 7,000 IOPS.</p>\n<p>In the near future, we plan to provide you with an automated way to migrate existing database instances to Provisioned IOPS storage for the MySQL and Oracle database engines. If you want to migrate an existing RDS database instance to Provisioned IOPS storage immediately, you can export the data from your existing database instance and import into a new database instance equipped with Provisioned IOPS storage.</p>\n<p>Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS can be used with all RDS features like Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and with all RDS-supported database engines (MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server). Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS is immediately available for new database instances in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), and EU West (Ireland) Regions. We plan to launch in our other AWS Regions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>To learn more and get started with Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS, please see the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds.html\">Amazon RDS detail page</a>, the <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.ProvisionedIOPS.html\">Amazon RDS User Guide</a> and the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.html\">Technical FAQ</a>.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"New High-Performance Provisioned IOPS Storage for Amazon RDS"}

To use this feature, you specify whether you want Amazon CloudFront to forward some or all of your cookies to your custom origin server. Amazon CloudFront then considers the forwarded cookie values when identifying a unique object in its cache. This way, your end users get both the benefit of content that is personalized just for them with a cookie and the performance benefits of Amazon CloudFront.</p>\n<p>Second, starting today you have a new option to lower the prices you pay to deliver content out of Amazon CloudFront. By default, Amazon CloudFront minimizes end user latency by delivering content from its entire global network of edge locations. However, because we charge more where our costs are higher, this means that you pay more to deliver your content with low latency to end-users in some locations. While this is the right choice for most Amazon CloudFront customers, we heard that for some use cases cost is a more important concern than latency. So, starting today we’re giving you the option to exclude the more expensive Amazon CloudFront locations from your distributions.</p>\n<p>By default, nothing changes: your existing distributions will continue to use the entire network of edge locations. However, if you wish, you can use the AWS Management Console or the Amazon CloudFront API to specify whether you want to deliver content only through a subset of edge locations (we call each subset a price class) where our prices are lower. Note, if you select a price class that does not include all locations, you’ll pay less, but your end users who would normally be served by the locations you exclude will experience higher latency than if your content was being served from all Amazon CloudFront locations.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have added three new fields to your Amazon CloudFront access logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The result type of each HTTP(s) request (for example, cache hit/miss/error).</li>\n<li>The cookie header in the request (if any). Logging of this field is optional.</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>The value of X-Amz-Cf-Id for that request.

You can then set the TTL for each file by setting the cache control header on your file in the origin. Amazon CloudFront uses cache control headers to determine how frequently each edge location gets an updated version of the file from the origin.

It provides low-latency performance by maintaining data on your on-premises storage hardware while asynchronously uploading this data to AWS, where it is encrypted and securely stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).  Using the AWS Storage Gateway, you can back up point-in-time snapshots of your on-premises application data to Amazon S3 for future recovery.  In the event you need replacement capacity for disaster recovery purposes, or if you want to leverage Amazon EC2’s on-demand compute capacity for additional capacity during peak periods, for new projects, or as a more cost-effective way to run your normal workloads, you can use the AWS Storage Gateway to mirror your on-premises data to Amazon EC2 instances.  \n<br><br>\nIf your on-premises applications are running in South America, using the Sao Paulo Region will reduce the time to upload data to AWS.  You can also use this Region to meet any requirements you have for keeping data in Brazil.

The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.  The AWS Storage Gateway supports industry-standard storage protocols that work with your existing applications.  It provides low-latency performance by maintaining data on your on-premises storage hardware while asynchronously uploading this data to AWS, where it is encrypted and securely stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).<br><br>\n\nUsing the AWS Storage Gateway, you can back up point-in-time snapshots of your on-premises application data to Amazon S3 for future recovery.  In the event you need replacement capacity for disaster recovery purposes, or if you want to leverage Amazon EC2’s on-demand compute capacity for additional capacity during peak periods, for new projects, or as a more cost-effective way to run your normal workloads, you can use the AWS Storage Gateway to mirror your on-premises data to Amazon EC2 instances.
