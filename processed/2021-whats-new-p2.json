Security analysts can quickly  visualize and examine aggregations of an IP address’s network and API activity as well as its resource interactions in Detective. These IP address details can be accessed either by searching for an IP address that needs to be investigated or by traversing to the IP address details as a part of a security investigation that is being conducted in Detective for resources that may have interacted with the IP address. When viewing an IP address’s details, Detective now enables security analysts to examine the actual users and roles that invoked API operations from the IP address. Security analysts can also use Detective to examine a visual summary of inbound and outbound network traffic patterns where the IP has been involved and “drilldown” to explore the traffic details for interactions between the IP address and EC2 instances across covered accounts. Detective retains collected summaries and analytics from ingested logs for 12 months easily enabling an examination of historical activity. </p>\r\n<p>These new capabilities will help simplify security analysis for your security and operations teams by enabling a quick assessment of an IP address’ activity across enabled AWS accounts and resources. Instead of exporting, storing, and analyzing VPC flow &amp; CloudTrail data in a custom or third-party tool, you can let Amazon Detective do the heavy lifting while you focus on quickly answering your investigative questions.

In a sample customer use case, an automotive manufacturer has plants and equipment located in Turkey, with data recorded in UTC.

The manager can define a metric as productivity_Monday=if(timestamp().localtime('PST').wday().eq(1), avg(productivity), none), which can later be used for comparing day-wise productivity.

For example, you have a music streaming application and let users listen to music files in an S3 bucket.

You can then reference this tag in the AWS IAM permissions policy to allow or deny actions. You can further restrict read access to premium music to paid users, by putting the membership attribute in the condition statement in the AWS IAM permissions policy and tag these files with the matching paying member status. Any new users with the matching token issuer and membership attributes will automatically gain access to the S3 bucket and premium music without additional permissions update.

UFCS can be used with all current function types supported in AWS IoT SiteWise — common, comparison, conditional, string, aggregation and temporal functions. UFCS can be used in the AWS IoT SiteWise console or Command Line Interface (CLI). To learn more about UFCS and function types, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/formula-expressions.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS IoT SiteWise formula expressions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The UFCS feature allows users to reference any function available in AWS IoT SiteWise today f(n) as n.f() using method calls. More generally, users can replace functions f(a,b,c...) using the syntax for method chaining as a.f(b,c..) where ‘a’ can be a variable or in itself a function a= f1(x). As a sample customer use case, if a user wants to define a metric that returns the log of a cosine function, log(cos(a)), they can now express it as cos(a).log() using UFCS. AWS IoT SiteWise also supports chaining of if-else functions using UFCS, making it easier to define and trace multiple levels of nested conditional logic. As a generic format, a nested if statement earlier written as:<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80.0px;\">if(condition1, on_true_1, if(condition2, on_true_2, on_false_2))</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\"><span>can now also be written using if-elif nesting under UFCS format as:</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80.0px;\">if(condition1, on_true_1). elif(condition2, on_true_2, on_false_2)<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>As an example, if a renewable energy site operator wants to test if the power output of a solar panel is within a certain range (1-4 kilowatt), they have the flexibility to encode it in two ways- efficiency= if(power.lt(1000),0).elif(power.gt(4000),0,1) using UFCS or if(lt(power, 1000), 0, if(gt(power,4000), 0,1)) using nested functions. In addition, UFCS can be used for method chaining with string operations. For example, a user can detect equipment status in a JSON message as status= contains(lower(jp(message, ‘$.status’)),‘fail’) using nested functions, or status= message.jp(‘$.status’).lower().contains(‘fail’) using the UFCS syntax. This allows for better traceability and troubleshooting in computations with multiple functions.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service to collect, store, organize and monitor data from industrial equipment at scale.&nbsp;To know more, visit the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/iot-sitewise.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS IoT SiteWise website</a> or the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/\" target=\"_blank\">developer guide</a>.
