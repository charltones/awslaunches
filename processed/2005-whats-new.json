However, when we think of interfaces between human beings and computers, we usually assume that the human being is the one requesting that a task be completed, and the computer is completing the task and providing the results. What if this process were reversed and a computer program could ask a human being to perform a task and return the results? What if it could coordinate many human beings to perform a task?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/mturk.html\">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> does this, providing a web services API for computers to integrate Artificial Artificial Intelligence directly into their processing.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Amazon Mechanical Turk"}
