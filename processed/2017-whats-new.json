These orders may be processed by a payment micro-service as well as an order fulfillment service in the application layer. The order fulfillment service doesn't need access to credit card numbers. With field-level encryption, CloudFront’s edge locations can encrypt the credit card data. From that point on, only applications that have the private keys can decrypt the sensitive fields. So the order fulfillment service can only view encrypted credit card numbers, but the payment services can decrypt credit card data.&nbsp;This ensures a higher level of security since even if one of the application services leaks plain text, the credit card data remains cryptographically protected.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Field-level encryption is easy to setup. Simply configure the fields that have to be further encrypted by CloudFront using the public keys you specify and you can reduce attack surface for your sensitive data. This makes it easier to meet security compliance requirements such as PCI DSS. Field-level encryption is charged based on the number of requests that need the additional encryption; you pay $0.02 for every 10,000 requests that CloudFront encrypts using field-level encryption in addition to the standard HTTPS request fee; see the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cloudfront/pricing.html\">pricing page</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how field-level encryption works, see our <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level-encryption.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.

CloudFront’s field-level encryption further encrypts sensitive data in an HTTPS form using field-specific encryption keys (which you supply) before a POST request is forwarded to your origin. This ensures that sensitive data can only be decrypted and viewed by certain components or services in your application stack.<br>\n</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Introducing Field-Level Encryption on Amazon CloudFront"}

All Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains using Elasticsearch 6.0 are bundled with Kibana 6.0, the corresponding version of the open-source visualization tool. </p>\n<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is powered by Apache Lucene 7.0.1 and offers several enhancements over the Elasticsearch 5.5 stack including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Improved efficiency of sparse fields:</u> Doc-values provide powerful columnar data store capabilities, but previously, Elasticsearch reserved a storage slot for every field in every column. With this release, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/minimize-index-storage-size-elasticsearch-6-0\">sparsely populated fields</a> consume far less disk space and make more efficient use of file system caching.</li>\n<li><u>Reduced disk consumption:</u> The “_all” field made it easy to get started with Elasticsearch by concatenating all values together, but it created a huge amount of duplicate data. The “_all” field is <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-all-field.html\">deprecated in Elasticsearch 6.0</a>, which can significantly reduce disk usage.</li>\n<li><u>Index sorting and faster query times:</u> You can now optimize Elasticsearch indexes to store documents on disk in a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/index-sorting-elasticsearch-6-0\">specific order</a>, which can allow queries to be returned more efficiently.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><u>Better query resource management:</u> A new control has been added to limit the maximum number of concurrent shard requests that can be served from a single search. This change intentionally slows down very broad searches and reduces their impact on other users.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><u>Kibana 6.0 accessibility improvements: </u>Colors throughout Kibana have been redesigned to have appropriate contrast settings for users with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/making-kibana-accessible\">color blindness</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><u>New experimental Kibana query language (Kuery): </u>The default search feature in Kibana is a simple query string, which limits the application’s utility. Kuery is a new query language designed to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-a-better-search-experience-in-kibana\">simplify Kibana’s search experience</a> and provide a foundation for powerful new features like named functions and scripted fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is now available in 14 regions globally: US East (N.

Messaging is the communications backbone that connects and integrates the components of distributed applications, such as order processing, inventory management, and fullfillment for e-commerce. Amazon MQ manages the administration and maintenance of ActiveMQ, a popular open-source message broker. Amazon MQ takes care of time-consuming tasks such as provisioning the infrastructure, setting up the broker, updating the software, and managing security. Amazon MQ is designed to withstand failures so your messages are highly available. With Amazon MQ, you get direct access to the ActiveMQ console and industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket.

It does all the heavy lifting behind the scenes for resource provisioning, service orchestration, scaling, healing, resiliency failover, monitoring, and reporting. With push-button deployment, customers can stand up live channels in minutes with resources that automatically scale up and down based on load and number of channels. To achieve the same result with on-premises solutions requires planning, procurement, installation, provisioning, configuration, setup, testing, and troubleshooting that can take weeks, months, or even years before going into production. The channel-based, pay-as-you-go service simplifies operational complexity, improves cost efficiency, and minimizes financial risk.

Previously ACM supported only email validation, which required the domain owner to receive an email for each certificate request and validate the information in the request before approving it. With DNS validation, you simply write a CNAME record to your DNS configuration to establish ownership or control of your domain name. The ACM management console can configure the DNS records for you if you manage your DNS records with Amazon Route 53. This makes it easy to validate your domain with a few mouse clicks. Once the CNAME record is configured, ACM can automatically renew DNS-validated certificates that are in use (associated with other AWS resources) before they expire, as long as the DNS record remains in place.

This means developers can configure backend features like User Sign-in once, and integrate it with an iOS, Android, Web, and React Native app, all through the console. Developers want to spend more time building quality apps, and less time wiring up their backends. To make this easier, we have introduced step-by-step wizards in our console, that walk the user through successfully integrating their app with an AWS backend. Additionally, we have also added higher order components (HOCs) in the Amplify library that lets users get started by writing 2-3 lines of code. For example, web app developers can add user sign-in UI to their app with 2 lines of code.<br>\n</p>\n<p>For developers looking at starting new projects from scratch, starter kits provide fully functional apps that are already cloud enabled. With one click, you can create a starter project which will automatically configure backend resources for you and provide sample client code to have you up and running with a cloud app without writing a single line of code.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We are also allowing developers to run performance tests on real devices for web apps hosted on Mobile Hub. Often, web-app developers only get the opportunity to run their apps on mobile emulators before releasing to the app stores. Now, with a single CLI command, developers can publish this web app to our fleet of iOS and Android devices in the AWS Device Farm for free. The web-app is run on a number of devices such as the iPhone 8 and Pixel 2 to gain real insights on app performance, with metrics such as time to first meaningful paint and time to first byte.

You can connect a device to AWS IoT 24/7 for an entire year for as little as $0.042 (US East – N. Virginia region). In order to maintain connectivity, devices may send keep-alive (“Ping”) messages at frequencies ranging from 20 minutes to every 30s, and you do not incur any additional cost for these messages. Messaging prices, which previously were $5 per million messages, start at just $1 per million messages and go as low as $0.70 (US East – N. Virginia region). Messages are now metered in 5 kilobyte increments (up from 512 bytes), which means workloads that exchange large messages will be metered for fewer messages.

Now you can front multiple backend origin application services with Amazon CloudFront and use Lambda@Edge to route requests to the appropriate origin dynamically, based on the attributes of the request. For example, you could have multiple microservices based backend origins that your Lambda@Edge functions can dynamically route to by inspecting request attributes like query strings, headers or cookies. Or you can route your viewers to the most optimal origin for latency or data locality if you happen to run geographically distributed applications in different AWS regions. Content-based dynamic origin selection also lets you simplify your origin infrastructure by moving request routing logic from a fleet of reverse proxy servers that you would have had to manage to serverless Lambda@Edge functions.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Network calls on viewer-facing events:</b> In addition to the remote network calls from origin-facing CloudFront events, Lambda@Edge now supports remote network calls from viewer-facing CloudFront events. For instance, you can now make remote calls to your authentication servers to verify user-privilege levels and serve premium vs. non-premium content based on what each user is authorized for.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Advanced response generation:</b> Now with support for binary responses (such as images) and higher Lambda function limits, you can move more complex logic to the edge than was possible previously. For example, with remote calls and binary response generation, you can now call services like <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rekognition.html\">Amazon Rekognition</a> to find interesting portions of images and resize, crop or compress them, add image watermarking or manipulate the images for optimal viewing experience on various viewer devices.

Second, you can make remote network calls from Amazon CloudFront viewer-facing events. Third, you can generate binary data from your Lambda@Edge functions which lets you deliver richer, more customized content using Amazon CloudFront.

Starting today, you can use Rekognition Text in Image to recognize and extract textual content from images. Text in Image is specifically built to work with real-world images rather than document images. It supports text in most Latin scripts and numbers embedded in a large variety of layouts, fonts, and styles, and overlaid on background objects at various orientation as banners and posters.</p>\n<p>For example, in image sharing and social media applications, you can now enable visual search based on an index of images that contain the same keywords. In media and entertainment applications, you can catalogue videos based on relevant text on screen, such as ads, news, sport scores, and captions. Additionally, in security and safety applications, you can identify vehicles based on license plate numbers from images taken by street cameras. </p>\n<p>“As a visually-driven platform, Pinterest relies heavily on the speed and quality of images, but the text behind those images is just as important, as it provides context and makes Pins actionable for our 200M+ active Pinners.

This meant that networking containers to communicate with other containers or external traffic sources required you to map the port on each container. This required knowing which ports were available for use and dynamically assigning ports to avoid conflicts. Additionally, using EC2 security groups and network monitoring tools was only possible for a host EC2 instance.</p>\n<p>Now, users can define an Amazon ECS task definition to use task networking. This allows elastic network interfaces to be assigned directly to running Amazon ECS tasks from the VPC subnets designated by the user. This task-level elastic network interface makes it possible to assign EC2 security groups and use standard network monitoring tools at the container level. This simplifies network configuration management, allowing you to treat each container just like an EC2 instance with full networking features in the VPC.</p>\n<p>To learn more about using task networking for your containers, see our <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-cloud-native-networking-for-ecs-containers/\">hands-on blog</a> or <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html\">documentation</a>.

This allows ElastiCache to deliver a fully online experience and enables the cluster to serve incoming I/O requests while resizing is in progress.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Redis command support</b> – ElastiCache uses atomic slot migration instead of the atomic key migration used by open source Redis. When a key is migrated to the target shard, the source shard maintains a copy and retains ownership of the key, until the entire slot and all its keys are migrated. While this improves performance, it also allows you to benefit from full Redis API coverage, including operations such as multi-key commands, transactions, and LUA scripts.</li>\n<li><b>No Client side changes needed </b>– The enhanced slot distribution used in cluster resizing workflow is compliant with Redis cluster client behavior and does not require any application changes.

With these features, you now have a fully managed experience for all your data encryption needs. You can start using the new features by enabling it at the time of cluster creation via the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\">ElastiCache console</a> or through the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationGroup.html\">API</a>. As long as the Redis clients support TLS protocol, you don’t have to modify your applications other than making a small configuration change to your Redis clients. The change to your Redis client is simple, for example, with a Jedis java client, while creating a Redis connection, you need to pass isTls=true flag.</li>\n<li>Complete Security Certificate Management: You don’t have to manage the lifecycle of your certificates because ElastiCache for Redis automatically manages the issuance, renewal, and expiration of your certificates. Key highlights include</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">I. Managed certificate issuance – ElastiCache for Redis takes care of certificate issuance process transparently to your application. You do not need to acquire a certificate from a certificate authority and deploy/upload the certificate once acquired. ElastiCache for Redis uses a trusted Certificate Authority behind the scenes, minimizing any client set up or costs associated with a third-party certificate authority.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">II. Managed certificate renewal – ElastiCache for Redis automatically manages the certificate renewal and deployment process for Amazon-issued TLS certificates eliminating manual errors. ElastiCache for Redis minimizes downtime due to misconfigured, revoked, or expired certificates.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">III. Secure Key Management – ElastiCache for Redis is designed to protect and manage the private keys used with certificates. Strong encryption and key management best practices are used when protecting and storing private keys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open-source S2N library for enhanced security – ElastiCache for Redis uses TLS 1.2 protocol and relies on <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/s2n\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon S2N</a> library to provide strong encryption. S2N is an open source implementation of the TLS protocol that is lightweight and fast while providing strong encryption. The S2N library uses advanced safety mechanisms like static analysis, penetration testing and built-in memory protection providing better security protections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no additional charge to use these features, and they are available in the US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo) Regions.

Storage and bandwidth requirements are reduced by as much as 30 times, and data transfer times and backup windows can be reduced by the same amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The AWS Cloud provides a suite of infrastructure services that enable you to deploy StorReduce in a highly available, fault-tolerant, and affordable way. With StorReduce on AWS, you can use StorReduce features such as deduplication, copy-on-write (COW) cloning of data, inter-regional/inter-cloud deduplicated replication, and much more with ease. You can deploy StorReduce within a new or existing VPC across multiple Availability Zones, with traffic distributed evenly across StorReduce’s endpoints through a load balancer. The deployment takes about 20 minutes for a cluster of three StorReduce servers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href=\"https://fwd.aws/eNqr4\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>.

The IBM Spectrum Scale software is being made available through a 90-day trial license evaluation program.</p>\n<p>                    This Quick Start automates the deployment of IBM Spectrum Scale on AWS for users who require highly available access to a shared name space across multiple instances with good performance, without requiring an in-depth knowledge of IBM Spectrum Scale. </p>\n<p>                    The Quick Start deploys IBM Network Shared Disk (NSD) storage server instances and IBM Spectrum Scale compute instances into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. Data and metadata elements are replicated across two Availability Zones for optimal data protection. You can build a new VPC for IBM Spectrum Scale, or deploy the software into your existing VPC. The automated deployment provisions the IBM Spectrum Scale instances in Auto Scaling groups for instance scaling and management. </p>\n<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href=\"https://fwd.aws/k5kRD\">GitHub repository</a>.

The rendering pipeline is comprised of thousands of client instantiations of the same rendering process. Deadline is a pipeline manager that orchestrates this distributed job.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since the Thinkbox acquisition by Amazon Web Services (AWS), many customers have asked us how to make the rendering experience in the cloud as simple as the one they have on-premises, while still leveraging the elasticity and flexibility of cloud. While we stay committed to delivering new and improved capabilities for on-premises deployments, like dynamic licensing and improved remote connection server, Deadline 10 is our first step into making rendering in the cloud a few click process through the new AWS Portal feature in Deadline. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deadline 10 includes usage-based licensing on AWS with Deadline for Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya and Arnold through the <a href=\"https://marketplace.thinkboxsoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thinkbox marketplace</a>. Chaos Group’s V-Ray has also been added to the marketplace, joining current Thinkbox partners - The Foundry’s NUKE and KATANA, Maxwell Render, Next Limit RealFlow, NVIDIA Iray and Mental Ray, Redshift and Peregrine Labs’ Yeti. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Enabling simple and secure expansion of on-premises render farms, Deadline 10 natively integrates with AWS via customers’ existing AWS accounts. It automatically connects to customers’ on-premises farms, tags AWS instances for tracking and synchronizes with local asset servers automatically to ensure all appropriate files have been transferred before rendering begins. With flexible third-party licensing options, Deadline 10 customers using AWS resources can purchase software licenses from the Thinkbox marketplace, deploy existing licenses or leverage a combination of the two. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new remote connection server feature enhances the secure connection to and interactions with remote and cloud-based render farms over public internet, reducing communication overhead and accelerating data transfers. Dynamic licensing allows Deadline workers to switch between floating licenses and usage based licensing so that users can expand render farms with AWS Portal without having to configure render nodes. By using a new unlimited option for third-party usage based licensing, customers can grow render farms elastically by tapping AWS resources.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deadline 10 is now available for usage based license customers; a new license is needed for traditional floating license users. Pricing for yearly Deadline licenses has been updated to $48 USD annually. Perpetual Deadline licenses continue to be available upon request or users may transition to yearly licenses.

This made it hard to organize, track, and manage parameters. Now you can use parameter hierarchy to define a parameter within a path, adding organizational structure and reducing the manual overhead of creating multiple parameters. This also allows you to query parameters by a path and create a single AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to manage similar parameters. Parameters can still individually be deleted or set to IAM policies, but now you can also perform these actions in bulk by specifying hierarchy paths.</p>\n<p>                 Parameters can now also be tagged, allowing you to easily categorize, filter, and control access depending on your business or IT needs. Tagging can be used with IAM policies to increase the control and security of parameters. For example, production passwords can be tagged and an IAM policy can be created that restricts access to only list the parameters, not the values. This creates a dynamic IAM policy depending on which parameters are included in the tag.</p>\n<p>Additionally, notifications and events can now be triggered based on the state of the parameter. You can receive an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) alert when a parameter is updated, deleted, or accessed. Through Amazon CloudWatch Events, a change to a parameter could initiate an AWS Lambda function, such as when you want to reset database connections when a password is updated.</p>\n<p>                 Systems Manager is available in <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services.html\">all regions</a>.</p>\n<p>                 For more information about Systems Manager Parameter Store, visit our <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/ec2/systems-manager/parameter-store/\">Product Page</a>.</p>\n","modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:53:04Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/amazon-ec2-systems-manager-adds-hierarchy-tagging-and-notification-support-for-parameter-store/","postDateTime":"2017-06-22T15:30:00Z","postSummary":"<p>                 Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports parameter hierarchy, tagging, and notifications, available through the Parameter Store capability.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Adds Hierarchy, Tagging, and Notification Support for Parameter Store"}

To claim your domain, your Amazon Chime account will automatically switch from a team account to an enterprise account. With an Amazon Chime team account, you can include users from any email domain; with an enterprise account, you have more control over users and data, and all Amazon Chime users with email addresses in your domain become managed.

There are two ways you can use Microsoft AD to manage your users. First, you can connect to your on-premises Microsoft AD using the AWS AD Connector. The AD Connector allows you to establish a trusted relationship between your AD and AWS. Second, you can use AWS Microsoft AD, a managed service built on Microsoft AD that runs on AWS. You can use the Amazon Chime console to configure Microsoft AD integration, and to assign Amazon Chime Plus or Pro subscriptions to directory groups.

Using this metadata stream, in combination with the synthesized speech audio stream, you can now build applications with an enhanced visual experience, such as avatars with speech-synchronized facial animations, or karaoke-style word highlighting. Speech Marks metadata requires a separate API request and incurs the same per-character pricing as for speech output, at a rate of $4.00 per 1 million characters, when outside of the free tier.

For instance, applications that perform heavy backend processing (e.g., database query, image processing) before responding to CloudFront may require a higher read timeout value than the default value of 30 seconds. You can also lower your read timeout, if you want to reduce load on a busy origin or serve an error response to the viewer quicker. For instance, for video streaming use cases, you may rely on the video player to quickly failover to a secondary URL by configuring a short timeout for your origin that CloudFront then proxies to your player.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The keep-alive idle timeout value specifies the maximum amount of time that CloudFront will maintain an idle connection with a custom origin server before closing the connection. The default keep-alive idle timeout value is 5 seconds, but you can now configure a higher value up to 60 seconds. Applications that incur less-frequent origin fetches may benefit from maintaining longer keep-alive connections with CloudFront to avoid the latency penalty incurred from re-establishing connections for subsequent requests or users. Note that this may require you to increase the keep-alive timeout value at your origin, in addition to scaling your origin infrastructure to keep connections open with CloudFront for a longer duration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These features are available today at no additional charge. You can use the AWS Management Console or the Amazon CloudFront API to configure these values.

This new SDK joins the Java version launched in 2016 to make encryption easier for developers while minimizing errors that could lower the security of their applications. Developers using encryption often face two problems: a. how to correctly generate and use a key to encrypt data, and b. how to protect the key after it’s been used. The AWS Encryption SDK addresses the first problem by transparently implementing the low-level details using the cryptographic provider available in a developer’s environment. The SDK addresses the second problem by providing intuitive interfaces to let developers choose how they want to protect their encryption keys after use. By using the AWS Encryption SDK, developers can focus on the core of the application they’re building instead of the complexities of encryption.
