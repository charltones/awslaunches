You can now choose which rules within the rule group should be excluded and set in count-only mode, preventing those rules from blocking a request. This will allow you to modify the behavior of a managed rule group so that it can be adapted to your unique environment.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, any customization within the managed rule group required you to reach out to your managed rules provider. Starting today, you can exclude individual rules within a managed rule group and change the action for the rule to COUNT. Therefore, requests that match an excluded rule are counted, but not blocked. This helps you try out new managed rule groups for AWS WAF, react faster to abnormal conditions, and gives you more control over your web ACLs.</p>\n<p>Adding a managed rule to the exception list is done in three steps. First, analyze incoming traffic using the full logging feature and look for unexpected behavior within the rule group. Second, identify the unwanted rule from the log. Lastly, exclude the rule either through the AWS WAF console or through the API.</p>\n<p>This feature has been enabled for all customers at no additional cost.

Query plan management allows you to prevent plan regressions when the database system or environment changes, and allows you to control when and whether the optimizer can use new plans.<br>\n<br>\nThe quality and consistency of query optimization have a major impact on the performance and stability of any relational database management system (RDBMS). Query optimizers create a query execution plan for a SQL statement at a specific point in time. As conditions change, the optimizer might pick a different plan that makes performance worse. For example, changes in statistics, constraints, environment settings, query parameter bindings, and software upgrades can all cause the query optimizer to choose a different plan and lead to performance regression. Regression is a major concern for high-performance applications.<br>\n<br>\nWith query plan management, you can control execution plans for a set of statements that you want to manage. You can do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve plan stability by forcing the optimizer to choose from a small number of known, good plans.</li>\n<li>Optimize plans centrally and then distribute the best plans globally.</li>\n<li>Identify indexes that aren't used and assess the impact of creating or dropping an index.</li>\n<li>Automatically detect a new minimum-cost plan discovered by the optimizer.</li>\n<li>Try new optimizer features with less risk, because you can choose to approve only the plan changes that improve performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use the new version, you can create an Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility database instance with just a few clicks in the <u><a>AWS Management Console</a></u>.

Until today, to enable access, you could run a hardware VPN appliance in your data center or deploy a software-based VPN appliance on Amazon EC2. Setup, security, and maintenance of self-managed client-based VPN solutions present an operational challenge and ongoing burden. Unforeseen events, such as a snow day, could require a large number of employees to connect from a remote location and further strain your VPN. It often led to reduced VPN availability for employees.</p>\n<p>With AWS Client VPN, you can now provide highly available and secure VPN access to all your employees regardless of their location. AWS Client VPN is a pay-as-you-go fully-managed service, eliminating the need to deal with the capital expense of buying hardware VPN appliances, or the operational complexity of scaling and patching. Customers can choose certificate-based or Active Directory authentication, and benefit from tighter security controls by defining access control rules based on Active Directory groups. Using a single console, you can easily monitor and manage all of your VPN connections. AWS Client VPN allows you to choose from OpenVPN-based clients, giving your employees the option to use the device of their choice, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux.</p>\n<p>AWS Client VPN is available in US East (Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon) and EU (Ireland) AWS Regions.

As you grow the number of workloads in AWS across multiple accounts, you need to scale your networks, control your connectivity policies better, and monitor your network effectively. Today, you can connect pairs of Amazon VPCs using VPC peering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across large number of Amazon VPCs, without centrally managing connectivity and routing policies, can be operationally costly and cumbersome. This solution can be hard to manage hundreds of Amazon VPCs.</p>\n<p>With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from a central gateway to each Amazon VPC, on premises data center, or remote office. AWS Transit Gateway acts as a hub where traffic is routed to all the connected networks, the spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the AWS Transit Gateway. With effective routing policies on the Transit Gateway, you have centralized control over how your Amazon VPCs and on-premises networks connect to each other. This connectivity model makes it easy and simple for you to scale and monitor your networks over time.</p>\n<p>With this announcement, AWS Transit Gateway is now available in a total of 14 AWS Regions around the world.

If a table does not contain partitions or sub-partitions, you can specify row ranges to migrate each segmented range in parallel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><u>Improved LOB Migrations: </u></b>You can now control large object (LOB) settings at the table level. It was previously supported for all tables in a task at the task level. We also introduced a new LOB mode which combines the advantages of limited and full LOB modes from the previous versions. For example, when a LOB migration encounters truncation in limited LOB mode, DMS will automatically switch to full LOB mode, complete migrating that particular big LOB and switch back to limited LOB mode, and continue migrating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><u>Control Table Load Order:</u></b> You can now control the order of tables loaded during the full load phase. For example, if your selected tables list contains tables of different sizes, you can set up the load order in a way that the smaller tables are loaded before the larger tables.</p>\n<p>For more information about new enhancements in DMS, please read <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-aws-dms-replication-engine-version-3-1-2/\" target=\"_blank\">our blog</a>.&nbsp;For AWS DMS availability, refer to the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS region table</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS Database Migration Service Adds Support for Parallel Full Load and Enhanced LOB Migration"}

With VPC sharing, your IT team can own and manage your Amazon VPCs and your application developers no longer have to manage or configure Amazon VPCs, but they can access them as needed.<br>\n</p>\n<p>You can also share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries.

For example, you can set up a campaign to trigger a message when a customer creates a new account, or when they add an item to their cart but don’t purchase it. Event-based campaigns help you send messages that are timely, personalized, and relevant to your customers, which ultimately increases their trust in your brand and gives them a reason to return.</p>\n<p>Event-based campaigns address both transactional and targeted campaign use cases. For transactional workloads, imagine you want to send a receipt each time a customer uses mobile pay; you can create event-based campaigns to address this in as little as 4 clicks. Targeted event-based campaigns are a great way to introduce cross-sale opportunities for complementary items. For example, if a customer adds a phone to their mobile shopping cart, you can trigger an in-app push notification that offers a discount on a case that fits the device that they’re purchasing.</p>\n<p>There are no additional charges associated with creating event-based campaigns. You pay only for the number of endpoints that you target, the number of messages that you send, and the number of analytics events that you send to Amazon Pinpoint (detailed pricing info <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/pinpoint/pricing.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).

The Runtime API for AWS Lambda defines a standardized HTTP-based specification which codifies how Lambda and a function’s runtime communicate. It enables you to build custom runtimes that integrate with Lambda to execute functions in response to events. By leveraging the Runtime API, you can use binaries or shell scripts, and your choice of programming languages and language versions. Getting started with Runtime API is simple. When deploying your function using the Lambda management console or CLI, specify that you are providing your own runtime. During an invoke, Lambda will bootstrap your runtime code and communicate with it over Runtime API to execute the function code. With this release, we are also publishing a reference implementation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-cpp\">C++</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime\">Rust</a> runtimes. You can read more about the Runtime API in the Lambda <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html\">documentation</a>.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Lambda Layers are a new type of artifact that can contain arbitrary code and data, and may be referenced by zero, one, or more functions at the same time. Lambda functions in a serverless application typically share common dependencies such as SDKs, frameworks, and now runtimes. With layers, you can centrally manage common components across multiple functions enabling better code reuse. To use layers, you simply put your common code in a zip file, and upload it to Lambda as a layer. You then configure your functions to reference it. When a function is invoked, the layer contents become available to your function code. We are also providing a layer which includes the popular NumPy and SciPy scientific libraries for Python. These libraries were prebuilt and optimized for use in Lambda’s execution environment. By using this layer with your Python functions, you can quickly get started with building complex data processing and machine learning applications. Read more about Lambda Layers in the AWS Lambda <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html\">documentation</a>.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Runtime API and Layers can be used independently. You can also use them together to publish custom runtimes which can be then shared as layers. You can also use the <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model\">AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/sam-cli-requirements.html\">SAM CLI</a> to test, deploy and manage serverless applications that leverage Runtime API and Layers.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>With this release, several of our technology partners are also launching their offerings on top of Runtime API and Layers.

Using hibernate, you can maintain a fleet of pre-warmed instances with memory footprint that can get to a productive state faster. You can do this without modifying your existing applications. Hibernate is just like closing and opening your laptop lid, with your application starting up right where it left off.</p>\n<p>Upon hibernation, your instance’s EBS root volume and any other attached EBS data volumes are persisted between sessions. Additionally, data from memory (RAM) is also saved to your EBS root volume. Upon resume, your EBS root device is restored from its prior state, including the RAM content. Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID. While the instances are in hibernation, you pay only for the EBS volumes and Elastic IP addresses attached to it.</p>\n<p>This feature is available for On-Demand and Reserved Instances running on freshly launched M3, M4, M5, C3, C4, C5, R3, R4, and R5 instances running Amazon Linux 1. The AMI snapshot used to launch the instance must be encrypted. This ensures protection of sensitive contents in memory (RAM) as they get copied to the root volume.</p>\n<p>You can enable hibernation for your EBS-backed instances at launch. You can then hibernate and resume your EBS-backed EC2 instances through the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home\">AWS Management Console</a>, or though the AWS SDK and CLI using the existing stop-instances and start-instances commands.</p>\n<p>EC2 Instance Hibernation is now available in the US East (N.

Ground stations are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellite by using antennas to receive satellite data and control systems to command and control the satellites. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downlinked, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellites.<br>\n</p>\n<p>AWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a satellite ground station-as-a-service. We provide the AWS Cloud and our low-latency global fiber network right where your data is downlinked into our ground stations. This enables you to easily control satellite communications, quickly ingest and process your satellite data, and rapidly integrate that data with your applications and other services running in the AWS Cloud. For example, you can use Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, or Amazon S3 to store and share the data, hunt for real-time business insights with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon EMR, apply machine learning algorithms and models with Amazon SageMaker, add image analysis with Amazon Rekognition, and improve data sets by combining satellite data with IoT sensor data from AWS Greengrass.<br>\n</p>\n<p>AWS Ground Station can help you save up to 80% on the cost of your ground station operations by using a fully-managed ground station instead of building and operating your own global ground station infrastructure.

In real world images, various aspects can impact a system’s ability to detect faces with high accuracy: pose variations caused by head movement and/or camera movements, occlusion due to foreground or background objects (faces covered by hats, hair, hands, or another person), illumination variations such as low contrast and shadows, or bright lighting leading to washed out faces, low quality and resolution leading to noisy and blurry faces, and distortion from cameras and lenses themselves. These issues manifest as both missed detections (a face not detected) or false detections (an image region detected as face even when there is no face). For example, in social media different poses, camera filters, lighting and occlusions (photo-bomb) are common. For financial services customers, verification of customer identity as a part of multi-factor authentication and fraud prevention workflows involves matching a high resolution selfie (a face image) with lower resolution, small and often blurry image of face on a photo identity document (such as a passport or driving license). Also, many customers have to detect and recognize faces of low contrast from images where the camera is pointing at a bright light.</p>\n<p>With the latest updates, Amazon Rekognition can now detect 40% more faces - that were previously missed - in images that have some of the most challenging conditions stated above, while reducing the rate of false detections by 50%. This means that customers such as social media apps can get consistent and reliable detections (fewer misses, fewer false detections) at higher confidence, allowing them to deliver better customer experiences in use cases like automated profile photo review. In addition, face recognition now returns 30% more correct 'best' matches (the most similar face) compared to our previous model when searching against a large collection of faces, enabling customers to get better search results in applications like fraud prevention. Face matches now also have more consistent similarity scores across varying lighting, pose and appearance, allowing customers to use higher confidence thresholds, avoid false matches, and reduce human review in applications such as identity verification. As always, for use cases involving civil liberties or customer sentiments, where the veracity of the match is critical, we recommend customers use best practices, higher confidence level (at least 99%), and always include human review.</p>\n<p>Amazon Rekognition face detection and face recognition enhancements are available today in all regions where Amazon Rekognition Image and Video are offered. You can get started today via the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/\">Amazon Rekognition Console</a> or by downloading the latest <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">AWS SDK</a>.

With the power of Lambda, you can use these functions to perform analytics on communication within your organization, log audit trails of messages sent, or even gain insights into the sentiment or other communication patterns of your organization. You can also trigger additional, custom actions according to the email being sent. For example, you can use a Lambda function to notify email recipients about an urgent email through additional communication channels like Amazon Chime or text message.</p>\n<p>To get started, first create a Lambda function using the AWS Lambda console. For example, a function that records metrics or triggers additional actions. Then, go to the Amazon WorkMail console to select the Lambda action in your organization's outbound mail flow rules settings. You can optionally specify which sender and receiver the rule should apply to. Now, when an email is sent from your Amazon WorkMail organization, Amazon WorkMail will pass the recipients and subject text to your Lambda function. To get you up and running even more quickly with Lambda for WorkMail, try starting with the WorkMail Hello World function from the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/serverless/serverlessrepo.html\" target=\"_blank\">Serverless Application Repository</a>. This template function shows you how to publish metrics to CloudWatch whenever an email is sent. Alternatively, you can start a Lambda function from scratch to create custom functionality in a programming language of your choice. Finally, you can even publish your own Lambda functions through the Serverless Application Repository for other Amazon WorkMail customers to use.</p>\n<p>Lambda for WorkMail is available today in all <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Regions</a>&nbsp;where Amazon WorkMail is offered.

Rules are applied directly to your Amazon VPC and can be shared across multiple accounts. These rules will allow you to forward names like “example.com” across AWS Direct Connect and AWS Managed VPN so that it can resolve DNS names that are served from your data center. Conversely, you can create a Route 53 Resolver endpoint that serves as a forwarding target for your on-premises DNS server. This way workloads in your data center can resolve DNS names from services such as Route 53 Private DNS, AWS Private Link, Amazon Elastic File System, AWS Active Directory Service, and more.<br>\n<br>\nTo learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\">Route 53 product page</a> for full details and pricing, or see our <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html\">documentation</a>.<br>\n</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon Route 53 Announces Amazon Route 53 Resolver, Simplifying DNS for Hybrid Cloud"}

You can now resolve DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from a peered VPC in another AWS Region. Using DNS names to access resources makes application development and management simpler and less error-prone. By using DNS resolution over Inter-Region VPC Peering,  resources in peered VPCs in another AWS Region are always accessed over the Inter-Region VPC Peering connection.</p>\n<p>Inter-Region VPC Peering allows VPC resources running in different AWS Regions, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and Lambda functions, to communicate with each other using private IP addresses, without requiring gateways, VPN connections, or separate network appliances. Built on the same scalable, redundant, and highly available technology that powers VPCs today, Inter-Region VPC Peering encrypts inter-region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck. Traffic using Inter-Region VPC Peering always stays on the AWS global network and never traverses the public internet. This approach reduces the attack surface to threat vectors, such as common exploits and DDoS attacks. </p>\n<p>You can enable DNS resolution for Inter-Region VPC Peering using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

They are looking for ways to quickly search and filter such content. Human-provided metadata works to a degree for such applications, but that approach has limited accuracy and scalability. With Amazon Rekognition object and scene detection, customers can automatically index vast image libraries to make them searchable.</p>\n<p><i>“GuruShots connects and inspires millions of photo enthusiasts around the world, reinventing the way people interact with their photos to make the experience more fun, exciting and rewarding. Previously, our end users were manually tagging images to get better insights. To provide a better customer experience, we’ve been looking for scalable ways to automatically tag uploaded images for further analysis. Using Amazon Rekognition, we now tag each user uploaded image and use the generated metadata to detect trends, improve search results, and adjust content to suit user preferences. This new streamlined process resulted in a 40% increase in user retention and a 50% increase in engagement.” </i>- Eran Hazout, Founder and CTO, GuruShots</p>\n<p>Now with object bounding boxes, customers can count how many of each object appears in an image (“3 dogs”), and can also determine which objects are prominent or important compared to others by using the position coordinates and bounding box size relative to image dimensions. This information can be used to make decisions on user preferences. For example, someone who has lot of photos where 'Car' is prominent is likely to be an automotive enthusiast. Some customers will also use bounding boxes to further process their images, for example to blur certain objects like weapons. Bounding box information can be further used to search for specific types of images (images with multiple dogs, or prominent dogs, versus one dog in the background). To make asset search even more powerful, Amazon Rekognition now returns parent labels in a hierarchical list, for example, the label 'Dog' has the parents 'Mammal', 'Canine' and 'Animal'. This metadata allows customers to group labels related by parent-child relationships to improve categorization and filtering.</p>\n<p>Bounding boxes, hierarchical metadata, and improved label detection accuracy are available today in all regions where Amazon Rekognition Image is offered.

Outbound mail flow rules allow you to perform simple control actions like blocking sending of a message or routing messages to a custom appliance via the SMTP protocol. This adds extensibility to the WorkMail product by allowing you to control sending or delegate handling of outbound e-mail to 3rd party or custom appliances. For example, you can now route to appliances for data leak protection, email encryption, IP reputation management, and archiving. Furthermore, you can specify conditions for each outbound mail flow rule based on the domain and email addresses of the message sender and recipients. The rule will then only run when the sender and recipients match the rule's condition. This way you can route traffic differently depending on who is sending and who they are sending to. This control is especially useful if you are routing to appliances with a per-user cost model, so you can route to only the users who need it. Finally, this feature complements Amazon WorkMail’s interoperability with Microsoft Exchange by enabling customers who are transitioning from Exchange to WorkMail to route outbound email through their existing on-premises Exchange setup.</p>\n<p>Like inbound mail flow rules, setting up outbound mail flow rules is easy with just a few quick steps in the Amazon WorkMail console. To get started, go to your Amazon WorkMail organization and click on Organization Settings. You can specify rules with the drop, bounce, or the SMTP routing actions, together with which sender and recipient email addresses or domains the rule should apply to. </p>\n<p>Outbound mail flow rules are available today for Amazon WorkMail in all <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon WorkMail is offered.

Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types as well as over 50 global Availability Zones where you can run your applications. Some customers however have very specific requirements for portions of their applications around instance type, size, and capability, as well as the Availability Zone the instance needs to run in, and need very high levels of assurance that they will always be able to launch that specific capacity. Previously in order to achieve a capacity reservation, customers had to leverage Zonal Reserved Instances and commit to that capacity for a minimum of one year. Now with On-Demand Capacity Reservations, customers can reserve the exact capacity they need, in the location they need, and can keep it only for as long as they need it.</p>\n<p>On-Demand Capacity Reservations are activated as soon as they are requested, and they stay active until cancelled. A Capacity Reservation is tied to a specific Availability Zone and, by default automatically utilized by running instances in that Availability Zone. Instances you have placed Capacity Reservations for are charged at the normal instance rate for as long as you maintain the reservation. Should you no longer need them, you can cancel your Capacity Reservation at any time to stop paying.</p>\n<p>If you have Regional RI discounts, they will automatically apply to any matching Capacity Reservation. This gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage.</p>\n<p>To get started, you can create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation by simply choosing an Availability Zone and quantity (number of instances) along with other instance specifications such as instance type and tenancy. Once created, the Capacity Reservation will ensure that you will always be able to launch that specific EC2 configuration.</p>\n<p>On-Demand Capacity Reservations are now available in all public Regions. You can create and manage Capacity Reservations through the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home\">AWS Management Console</a>, AWS SDK and CLI.

Tensorflow libraries can be combined with big data processing engines like Spark on EMR to speed up the model training process by parallelizing the tuning of training parameters. The trained model can then be broadcast to all the nodes of the cluster to perform distributed inference on a large amount of data that are too big to run on a single node. TensorFlow on EMR is packaged with TensorBoard, a visualization tool, that helps you visualize and debug the flow of tensor graph in real-time, understand the effects of your design choices, and further optimize your model. TensorFlow builds on EMR vary by the instance type you use for your cluster.</p>\n<p>With EMR release 5.17.0, you can use S3 Select with Spark. This feature allows your Spark application to selectively query a subset of data from a large object in S3. This improves performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred to and processed by the EMR cluster. Additionally, with this release, you can configure JupyterHub on EMR to save and persist notebooks directly to S3.

This leading price to performance makes T3 instances the primary choice for general-purpose workloads across the AWS customer base.</p>\n<p>T3 instances start in Unlimited mode by default giving users the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while keeping cost as low as possible.

In Unlimited mode, if the instance uses up all of its earned credit balance, the CPU performance will not be throttled. Instead, if the instance needs to run at higher CPU utilization for a prolonged period, it can do so with an additional charge of 5 cents/vCPU-hour. This enables customers to enjoy a low T3 instance hourly price at most times while ensuring that their instances can burst beyond the baseline if required.

For example, an increase in traffic could cause the average CPU utilization of your Aurora Replicas to go up and beyond your specified value.

The concerts we support no longer have lines and the attendees have enjoyed the convenience and fun experience of using our new ‘Face Ticket’ system. When we were developing this service we compared Rekognition with other local facial analysis services, and we ultimately decided to use Rekognition due to its scalability with S3 and the seamless integration with other AWS services.”</p>\n<p>  Shaadi.com is one of the world’s largest online matchmaking services, helping people around the world meet their life partners through a curated database of verified profiles. Great photos are critical to a positive user experience. To ensure photos are appropriate and conform to the site's guidelines, Shaadi.com uses a team dedicated to reviewing user-uploaded photos. Automation promised to streamline the process, but the resource requirements in its previous environment were prohibitive. “Automating photo review on traditional infrastructure would have required us to procure, deploy, and manage multiple applications as well as new hardware,” says Ajay Poddar, Vice President of Engineering. Instead, Shaadi.com adopted Amazon Rekognition using a combination of AWS Lambda serverless compute and custom APIs. “Using Amazon Rekognition, we quickly and affordably automated a highly complex process,” says Poddar. “We expect to reduce the time it takes for a picture to appear on a user’s profile by 95 percent, and we have cut manual work by 50 percent.”</p>\n<p>You can start building with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Rekognition</a> today using the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Rekognition Console</a> or by referring to the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.

Until today, you had the option of selecting the single cheapest Instance Pool for Spot and On-Demand, or diversifying Spot Instances across multiple instance types and AZs in an EC2 Fleet.</p>\n<p>Starting today, you can use Prioritized List to specifically determine the order in which EC2 Fleet attempts to fulfill your On-Demand capacity. EC2 Fleet will attempt to launch all capacity using the instance with the highest priority first, and if all your capacity cannot be fulfilled using your highest priority instance then EC2 Fleet will attempt launching capacity using the second priority instance type. You can define a priority for all instances you specify in your EC2 Fleet.</p>\n<p>Starting today you can also balance desired cost and availability&nbsp;in the context of applications by directing EC2 Fleet to evenly deploy Spot capacity across the N lowest priced Instance Pools. For example if you are running batch processing, you may prefer to set N to just 2 to maximize savings while attempting to ensure your queue always has compute capacity.

Starting today, your executable code acts much like an AWS Lambda function, can be invoked by events or invoke other Lambdas, and can take advantage of other Greengrass functionality such as Local Resource Access. You can mix and match executable code together with Lambda functions written in interpreted languages such as Python or Node.js.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"New AWS Greengrass Version Deploys Executable Code Written in C, C++, and Other Languages That Import C Libraries, and More"}

Many data sets come with incomplete data leading to incorrect forecasts. With DeepAR in SageMaker, missing values are now handled within the model, making forecasting easier and more accurate by utilizing the recurrent neural networks (RNN) model. The second enhancement for DeepAR algorithm is the ability to support custom time-varying features such as seasonality patterns that vary at different levels of a hierarchy across different time series. Third, DeepAR supports grouping of time series with multiple attributes, also known as multiple groupings. With this enhancement, DeepAR can learn group-specific behavior such as seasonality patterns for better forecasts. Lastly, a new notebook that can show how to process a real-world dataset on Amazon SageMaker with DeepAR has been released. This dataset consists of the hourly electricity consumption of 370 customers that has been used academic publications such as “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110\">DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks</a>”. For more information on DeepAR in Amazon SageMaker, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html\">documentation here</a>.</p>\n<p>  BlazingText provides an optimized implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm to take advantage of GPU hardware. The algorithm learns high-quality distributed vector representations of words in a large collection of documents. This is used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition. The first enhancement with BlazingText in SageMaker enables generation of meaningful vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that do not appear in the training dataset. Second, high-speed multi-class and multi-label text classification is supported with BlazingText. The goal of text classification is to automatically classify the text documents into one or more defined categories. BlazingText can now train a text classification model on more than a billion words in a couple of minutes. For more details on BlazingText in Amazon SageMaker, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/blazingtext.html\">documentation here</a>.</p>\n<p>  The Linear Learner algorithm in Amazon SageMaker now supports multi-class classification, in addition to binary classification and linear regression. This is a task where the outputs are known to be in a finite set of labels. As an example, emails could be classified as inbox, work, personal etc. Linear Learner can now be used for such datasets. Details of Linear Learner can be found <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>  Amazon SageMaker’s pre-configured containers now support Chainer 4.1.

The new development tools now support up to 60 kernels (compared to 16 in previous versions) enabling more compute for C /C++ based accelerators.</p>\n<p>In addition, based on customer feedback, the direct memory access (DMA) performance has been improved by 5x, allowing the FPGA acceleration engine to stream data to/from the CPU at high speed and increase application performance.</p>\n<p>To help offload the non-differentiated tasks of building an FPGA application such as transferring data to/from the host CPU and accessing onboard DRAM from the FPGA, we provide an Amazon FPGA Shell that provides pre-configured, pre-tested, and secure I/O components. With this release we are making the new Amazon FPGA v1.4 Shell reconfigurable, allowing developers to have future-proof designs. Simply put, this means that developers can decide if they'd like to upgrade Shell versions as they become available, compared to previous Shells that were mandatory upgrades. We also added a new capability that allows developers to retain data in the FPGA attached DRAM while swapping Amazon FPGA Images (AFIs) at runtime, which effectively decreases load times of certain AFIs, as there is no need to move data to/from the host into the FPGA DRAM when a new AFI is loaded.</p>\n<p>Developers can also take advantage of the growing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;searchTerms=FPGA\">marketplace of F1 instances based offerings</a> from AWS Partners and other developers, ranging from video encoding to data analytics. All of these new features and upgrades are available for F1 instances in 4 AWS regions - US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland) and AWS GovCloud (US) regions.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of new feature and upgrades, please <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md\">click here</a>.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon EC2 F1 Instances Adds New Features and Performance Improvements"}

Typically, you’ll start with something random and iterate through adjustments as you begin to see what effect the changes have. It can be a long cycle depending on how many hyperparameters your model has.<br>\n<br>\nAmazon SageMaker simplifies this by offering automatic model tuning as an option during training. Amazon SageMaker will actually use machine learning to tune your machine learning model. It works by learning what affects different types of data have on a model and applying that knowledge across many copies of the model to quickly seek out the best possible outcome. As a developer or data scientist, this means you only really need to be concerned with the adjustments you want to make to the data you feed the model, which greatly reduces the number of things to worry about during training.

Previously, customers could match a string (or use a regex) against the full query string without differentiating individual name-value pairs. With this enhancement, customers can write WAF rules for application vulnerabilities embedded in the query string and benefit from more targeted look-ups and more granular detections thus reducing false positives on query argument names. For example, in the URL https:// example.com/page?name1=value1&amp;name2=value2, customers can now write a string match condition to match the value “value1” for the query argument “name1” as well as a size constraint condition(s) on one or more of the name-value pairs in the query string.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Support for non-octet CIDR boundaries allows customers to use more granular subnet boundaries by configuring any subnet mask between /16 and /32 for IPv4 addresses. Previously, AWS WAF’s IP match condition supported only /8, /16, /24 and /32 subnets for IPv4. Now, customers can write AWS WAF rules to match on CIDRs such as 10.21.3.44/31, 10.21.3.40/29, 10.21.3.45/17, and so on. This allows for better aggregation of IPs into fewer entries in the IP lists which currently support 10,000 CIDR entries per list. We will also continue to support the existing IPv6 CIDR boundaries, which are: /128 /64 /56 /48 /32 and /24.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no additional charge for either of these new features.

In the past, SQA needed user defined 'maximum run time' (between 1-20 seconds) to identify short queries. With this update, by setting the maximum short query run time to 'dynamic,' you can let Redshift automate this setting.

Memory-optimized instance families such as Amazon EC2 X1 instances and Amazon EC2 R4 instances offer high RAM-to-vCPU ratio to help customers select appropriately sized EC2 instances. With Optimize CPUs, customers now have the added flexibility of specifying a custom number of vCPUs for new instances, while enjoying the same memory, storage, and bandwidth of a full-sized instance. For example, a x1e.4xlarge instance currently offers 16 vCPUs by default but customers can now launch x1e.4xlarge with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14 vCPUs.&nbsp;This enables Bring Your Own license (BYOL) customers to optimize their vCPU-based licensing costs. Please note that CPU optimized instances will have the same price as full-sized EC2 instances of the same size.</p>\n<p>We are also offering customers ability to disable Intel HT Technology on EC2 instances. While, Intel HT Technology is enabled by default on EC2 instance types, certain applications such as high-performance computing (HPC) applications are not designed to benefit from Intel HT Technology.

For example, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to cache and forward a country header to your S3 origin, and then use Lambda@Edge to dynamically redirect viewers to country-specific versions of your website, based on the viewer’s location. CloudFront also caches the responses to further improve the performance on subsequent requests to your website.</p>\n<p>Until now, you could configure Amazon CloudFront with an S3 origin to forward and to cache objects based on only three headers: Access-Control-Request-Headers, Access-Control-Request-Method, and Origin. This limited the ability to leverage the full potential of Lambda@Edge, as you could only use cookies and query strings when you wanted to customize the delivery of content stored in S3 buckets. However, with this launch, you can now configure CloudFront with an S3 origin to cache and forward several additional headers, such as CloudFront-Viewer-Country or CloudFront-Is-*-Viewer, and then use Lambda@Edge to customize content based on these headers and deliver at low latencies to your viewers.
