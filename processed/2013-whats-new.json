Impala is an open source tool for real-time, \nad hoc querying using a familiar SQL-like language. By using Impala on Amazon EMR, you can perform fast interactive analytics \non unstructured data. For many types of queries, it's much faster than Hive. Impala's performance makes it a great engine for iterative \nqueries and many popular BI tools. With Amazon EMR, you can use Impala as a reliable data warehouse to execute \ntasks such as data analytics, monitoring, and business intelligence. Here are three use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Impala instead of Hive on long-running clusters to perform ad hoc queries. Impala reduces interactive queries to seconds, making it an excellent tool for fast investigation. You could run Impala on the same cluster as your batch MapReduce workflows, use Impala on a long-running analytics cluster with Hive and Pig, or create a cluster specifically tuned for Impala queries.\n</li>\n<li> Use Impala instead of Hive for batch ETL jobs on transient Amazon EMR clusters. Impala is faster than Hive for many queries, which provides better performance for these workloads. Like Hive, Impala uses SQL, so queries can easily be modified from Hive to Impala.\n</li>\n<li> Use Impala in conjunction with a third party business intelligence tool. Connect a client ODBC or JDBC driver with your cluster to use Impala as an engine for powerful visualization tools and dashboards.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To get started, you can launch an Amazon EMR cluster with Impala using the EMR Command Line Interface (CLI), Management Console, APIs, and SDKs. You also\nmust be using an AMI and Amazon distribution of Hadoop 2.x (AMI 3.0.2 or later).

In addition, if you did not have an equal number of healthy instances in each of the Availability Zones (e.g. if you had taken some instances down for maintenance), your requests would be balanced across a smaller number of healthy back-end instances in the affected Availability Zones – meaning that you would have to closely monitor and adjust your back-end instance capacity. </p>\n<p>If you enable cross-zone load balancing, you no longer have to worry that clients caching DNS information will result in requests being distributed unevenly.

To get started, navigate to the Amazon RDS page of the AWS Management Console, simply select the DB Snapshot to be copied, \nset the destination AWS Region, and start the copy. The copied DB snapshots behave exactly the same as existing DB snapshots. \nThey can be used to restore your data to new DB instances in the destination region. You can also set up <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.html\">DB Event Subscriptions</a> to receive notifications when the copy is complete.</p>\n<p>Once a DB Snapshot is copied to a specific AWS Region, any subsequent copy operations of the DB Snapshots of \nthe same DB Instance to that Region will only transfer the data that has changed since the last copy. Thus the subsequent copy operations transfer fewer amounts of data and complete faster. \n</p>\n<p>According to Joel Callaway, IT Operations Manager from Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a property and house prices website that attracts over 20 million visits per month, \n“We are very happy with RDS cross region snapshot copy feature as it gives us the ability to copy our data from one AWS region to another AWS region with minimal effort.\nPrior to this feature, it used to take 3 days and a number of manual steps to copy our snapshots.\n Now we have an automated process that helps us to achieve disaster recovery capabilities in just few steps.”</p>\n<p>You will be charged only for the data transferred to copy the DB Snapshot and to store the \ncopied snapshot at the destination region. As the DB Snapshot Copy is incremental as described above, for subsequent copy operations, \nyou will only pay for the transfer of the changed data since the last copy, reducing your cross-regional data transfer costs.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the DB Snapshot Copy section of the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/rds/\">Amazon RDS User Guide</a> to learn more. \n</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing point-and-click copy of Amazon RDS DB Snapshots across AWS Regions"}

This new feature lets you use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to transcode audio-only content like music or podcasts from one format to another. You can also use this new feature to create an audio-only alternate stream in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) file set, which is frequently needed to meet low bandwidth requirements for mobile applications.</p>\n<p>Audio transcoding with Amazon Elastic Transcoder works in the same way as video transcoding: you create a transcoding pipeline (or use one you’ve already defined) and submit a transcoding job that specifies either one of the new audio transcoding system presets or your own custom transcoding preset. You can choose to create output using the AAC, MP3 or Vorbis audio codecs. Metadata like track name, artist, genre and album art is included in your output file and you can specify replacement or additional album art if you wish.</p>\n<p>Amazon Elastic Transcoder has simple pricing: you pay according to the output duration of your content. There is no upfront commitment and you only pay for what you use. For audio-only transcoding, prices start at $0.0045/minute. To help you test Amazon Elastic Transcoder, you can use the AWS Free Tier. The Free Tier provides 20 minutes of free audio output per month, 20 minutes of free SD output per month and 10 minutes of free HD output per month. Please see <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/free.html\">AWS Free Tier</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Amazon Elastic Transcoder and this new feature by visiting the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/elastictranscoder.html\">detail page</a> and by reading the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/documentation/elastictranscoder.html\">documentation</a>.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon Elastic Transcoder Announces Audio Transcoding"}

This release adds support for five additional HTTP methods, including POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS and PATCH. This means you can improve the performance of dynamic websites that have web forms, comment and login boxes, “add to cart” buttons or other features that upload data from end users. It also means you can now use a single domain name to deliver your whole website through CloudFront thereby accelerating both the download and upload parts of your website.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>You can use existing Amazon CloudFront distributions for upload requests by simply enabling support in the AWS management console. When end users upload content, CloudFront will send the upload request back to the origin web server (such as an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or your own origin server) over an optimized route that uses persistent connections, TCP/IP and network path optimizations.</p>\n<p>There are no minimum usage commitments or long-term contracts to use CloudFront for uploading content. You simply pay for the data transfer and requests for what end users actually upload with the service. Data transfer prices for uploaded content are as much as 83% lower than the price for content downloads. Detailed pricing information is available on the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing\">Amazon CloudFront Pricing Page</a> (see Regional Data Transfer Out to Origin table).</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Amazon CloudFront’s support for these new HTTP methods by visiting the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cloudfront.html\">Amazon CloudFront Detail Page</a> or by reading the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/WorkingWithDownloadDistributions.html#DownloadDistValuesAllowedHTTPMethods\">Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.

Previously, CloudFront would respond with a standard HTML page that would be cached for 5 minutes. These two new features provide you with more control over error responses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Custom Error Pages</b> allow you to serve error pages with your own branding and content. For example, you can now help your visitors navigate to other sections of your website when they request an invalid URL, or you can configure a static page to serve as a fallback for failure of an origin webserver.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Configurable Cache Duration for Error Responses </b> allows you to specify how long you want each error page to be cached at CloudFront edge locations.

These new capabilities allow you to perform near zero downtime data migration from your external MySQL database instances (running on-premise or on Amazon EC2) to your Amazon RDS MySQL database instances and vice versa. </p>\n<p>Until now, in order to import data from your external MySQL instance to your Amazon RDS instance you had to start by setting up a baseline (using the mysqldump or mysqlimport utilities). Then, you had to manually replay the transactions that had occurred on your external MySQL instance since the initial baseline was created. This process was difficult and error-prone. Now, with this new feature, once your initial baseline is set, you can simply configure your Amazon RDS instance as a replication target for your external MySQL instance and capture all the transactions that have occurred since the time you setup the initial baseline.

We currently support the MySQL database engine version 5.6 for this instance type.</p>\n<p>AWS customers run a wide range of database workloads on Amazon RDS and have ever expanding memory, compute and IOPS requirements. This new instance type has 244GB of memory and 88ECUs of compute capacity (2 Intel Xeon E5-2670 8-core processors). This instance also operates on a high bandwidth network. For a workload with 50% writes and 50% reads running on this instance type, it is possible to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.ProvisionedIOPS.html#USER_PIOPS.Realized\">realize</a> up to 20,000 IOPS for MySQL, which is 60% more than previously realizable maximum IOPS of 12,500. Your actual results may vary depending on your workload characteristics. These specifications make this instance type an ideal candidate for high performance workloads in enterprise, social media, mobile applications or gaming. </p>\n<p>Please note that Amazon RDS for MySQL (version 5.6) provides support for both SQL and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.MySQL.Options.html\">Memcached </a>API access to the underlying data in your database. This means that using db.cr1.8xlarge with MySQL 5.6, you can architect applications that use SQL for complex transactions and joins as well as Memcached APIs for high performance NoSQL operations – all operating out of one database. In addition, with 244GB of available memory, you may be able to configure MySQL to fit most OLTP databases (typically 100GB or less) fully in memory and achieve the best possible performance.</p>\n<p>The db.cr1.8xlarge provides 3.6 times the memory and 3.4 times the compute capacity of db.m2.4xlarge, but only costs about 2.1 times that of db.m2.4xlarge. You may be able to consolidate your workloads from multiple smaller instances (read replicas/write shards/cache nodes for example) to fewer db.cr1.8xlarge instances, and reduce network latencies as well as minimize overall administrative effort and cost.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at $2.074 per hour (effective price) for 3 year Heavy Utilization and $4.725 per hour for On-demand usage in US East (Northern Virginia) and US West (Oregon).

Taking a database snapshot from a Read Replica instead, can help you mitigate this brief performance impact. However, please note that the database snapshots taken from a Read Replica at a given time may not include all the transactions present on the master at that time because of possible replica lag.</p>\n<p><b>Create a replica from an existing Read Replica</b> <b>(supported for MySQL 5.6)</b> - You can now create a second-tier Read Replica from an existing first-tier Read Replica. By creating a second-tier Read Replica, you may be able to move some of the replication load from the master database instance to a first-tier Read Replica.

App developers can now easily send push notifications to Apple, Google and Kindle Fire devices using one simple API, and easily scale from a few notifications a day to millions of notifications or higher.</p>\n<p>Our customers tell us that prior to availability of SNS Mobile Push, supporting push notifications at large scale was incredibly complicated.  Amazon, Apple, and Google each maintains a separate relay service to deliver notifications for devices running the platforms they own.  Supporting millions of users on multiple mobile platforms has often meant integrating with each of these platform-specific relay services, thus introducing operational complexity and cost for our customers.</p>\n<p>Customers tell us that virtually all use cases for push notifications require an intermediary application to manage security tokens, queue outgoing messages, and abstract platform-specific APIs.  Many developers tell us that they used to maintain their own intermediary relay applications, even though they found the process of operating these intermediaries to be painful and error prone.</p>\n<p>SNS Mobile Push alleviates the need to build and operate one’s own intermediary service, and enables developers to push once, deliver anywhere.  This reduces the cost and complexity for developers, as they do not have to integrate and maintain different versions of the same push software for multiple mobile platforms.</p>\n<p>With SNS, you can target unique messages to individual devices, or broadcast identical messages to many subscribers at once.  You can start using this feature right away at no charge.  The <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/free.html\">AWS Free Tier</a> means all AWS customers can send one million push notifications per month across iOS, Android and Kindle platforms at no charge.  After that, you pay $0.50 for each million messages that you publish, plus $0.50 for every million mobile push deliveries.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Amazon SNS Mobile Push, sign up for the <a href=\"http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=658423&amp;s=1&amp;k=89B8836C2FA8016E785FC90541CE8C14\">webinar</a> on August 29th, 2013.

For example, provisioning a RAID 0 setup, which involves the creation of multiple EBS volumes, is now faster because CloudFormation can provision the volumes in parallel. CloudFormation automatically determines which resources in a template can be created in parallel. CloudFormation template authors can use the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html\">DependsOn</a> attribute for control over the order of resource creation.</p>\n<h2>Nested Stack Updates</h2>\n<p>CloudFormation allows <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-stack.html\">nesting a stack</a> as a resource inside a template. This feature has enabled design and creation of related stacks together. Today, we are introducing the ability to update a top-level stack and its nested stacks together. Nested stack updates can be triggered by running the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStack.html\">UpdateStack</a> command on a top-level stack, or by selecting the top-level stack and clicking the ‘Update Stack’ button in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">CloudFormation Management Console</a>.

They are ideal for workloads where corporate policies or industry regulations require that your EC2 instances be isolated from instances that belong to other customers at the host hardware level.</p>\n<p>Like our multi-tenant EC2 instances, Dedicated Instances let you take full advantage of <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">On-Demand</a> and <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances/\">Reserved Instance</a> purchasing options. Today’s price drop continues the AWS tradition of exploring ways to reduce costs and passing on the savings to our customers. This reduction applies to both the dedicated per region fee and the per-instance On-Demand and Reserved Instance fee across all supported instance types and all AWS Regions. Here are the details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Dedicated Per Region Fee</strong> - An 80% price reduction from $10 per hour to $2 per hour in any Region where at least one Dedicated Instance of any type is running.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Dedicated On-Demand Instances</strong> - A reduction of up to 37% in hourly costs. For example the price of an <strong>m1.xlarge</strong> Dedicated Instance in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region will drop from $0.840 per hour to $0.528 per hour. </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Dedicated Reserved Instances</strong> - A reduction of up to 57% on the Reserved Instance upfront fee and the hourly instance usage fee. Dedicated Reserved Instances also provide additional savings of up to 65% compared to Dedicated On-Demand instances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These changes are effective July 1, 2013 and will automatically be reflected in your AWS charges.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Dedicated Instances and to see a complete list of prices, please visit the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/dedicated-instances/\">Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances</a> page.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Price Reductions on Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances"}

You can also define permissions for groups of resources based on tags associated with your EC2 and RDS resources or based on other attributes of the resource.   Whether you are a fast growing start-up or a large enterprise moving mission-critical workloads to AWS, these new features will give you more granular visibility and control over your development, test, staging and production deployments on EC2 and RDS.</p>\n<p>Using these resource-level permissions, you can define different permissions for different applications, environments, cost centers, departments, work groups, or any other organizational schema that you choose.  For example, you can define specific user groups such as “Developers” and “Production System Administrators,” and then tag the appropriate EC2 and RDS resources with “Development,” “Test,” and “Production.”  By setting up these granular IAM policies, you can dictate that only Developers can modify or delete ”Development” and “Test” resources, and only “Production System Administrators” can modify and delete “Production” resources.

You can also access it via the EC2 Command Line Interface or the EC2 API as described on the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html\">EBS Snapshot Copy</a> page. The copied snapshots behave the same as other snapshots in the destination region. You will be charged for the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#DataTransfer\">data transferred</a> and for the snapshot data stored in the destination region.</p>\n<p>This enhancement also improves the performance of EC2 AMI Copy. With EC2 AMI Copy, you can develop your AMIs in one region, and then copy them to other regions to develop a consistent, multi-region deployment. </p>\n<p>You can learn more about EBS Snapshot Copy by visiting the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html\">Amazon EBS Documentation</a> and about AMI Copy by visiting the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html\">EC2 User’s Guide</a>.\n  </p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon Announces Faster Cross-region EBS Snapshot Copy"}

Today, we are excited to announce two more features – Custom SSL Certificates and zone apex support – that make it easier for you to accelerate and deliver your whole website using Amazon CloudFront.</p>\n<p>Custom SSL Certificate support lets you deliver content over HTTPS using your own domain name and your own SSL certificate. This helps give visitors to your website lower latency and higher reliability along with the security benefits of CloudFront over an SSL connection that uses your own domain name. You can also configure CloudFront to use HTTPS connections for origin fetches so that your data is encrypted end-to-end from your origin to your end users.</p>\n<p>Configuring Custom SSL Certificate support is easy; you don’t need to learn any proprietary code or hire any consultants to configure it for you. Starting today, you can sign up for an invitation to use the Custom SSL Certificate feature by filling out the form on the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains\">custom SSL certificate feature page</a>. As soon as we approve your request, you can upload your SSL certificate and use the AWS Management Console to associate it with your CloudFront distributions.</p>\n<p>Pricing for Custom SSL Certificates is simple. We charge a fixed monthly fee for each custom SSL certificate you associate with your CloudFront distributions, pro-rated by the hour. As with other CloudFront features, you pay only for what you use and there are no upfront fees or minimum monthly commitments. You can learn more about Custom SSL Certificates by reading the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/SecureConnections.html#CNAMEsAndHTTPS\">Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, starting today you can now use Amazon CloudFront to deliver content from the root domain, or &quot;zone apex&quot; of your website. For example, you can now configure both http://www.example.com and http://example.com to point at the same CloudFront distribution, without the performance penalty or availability risk of managing a redirect service. To use this feature, you create an Amazon Route 53 Alias record to map the root of your domain to your CloudFront distribution. There are no extra fees from Route 53, as Alias queries that are mapped to a CloudFront distribution are provided free of charge. You can start using this feature today by reviewing the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html\">Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Learn more about custom SSL certificate and zone apex support by visiting the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains\">custom SSL certificate feature page</a>.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Custom SSL Certificates and Zone Apex Support for CloudFront"}

These price reductions follow a series of innovations we have launched recently (described later in this announcement). </p>\n<p> We have reduced the On-Demand prices by as much as 18% for MySQL and Oracle BYOL (Bring Your Own License) and 28% for SQL Server BYOL. All of your On-Demand usage will automatically be charged at the new and lower rates effective June 1, 2013. </p>\n<p>We have also reduced the Reserved Instance (RI) prices by as much as 27% for MySQL and Oracle BYOL.  The new prices apply to Reserved Instance purchases made on or after June 11, 2013. With the new pricing, Reserved Instances will provide savings of up to 76% compared to On-Demand instances, so you may want to take this opportunity to review your usage and decide whether to purchase additional Reserved Instances to take advantage of these savings. </p>\n<p>For your quick reference, new On-Demand prices for an M1.Small DB instance, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for an M2.Xlarge DB instance using a 3-Year Heavy Utilization RI are shown in the tables below:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Table 1: Amazon RDS for MYSQL and Oracle BYOL On-Demand Single-AZ Deployment Prices for M1.Small DB Instance </b></p>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"348\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"351\" height=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#999\"><tbody>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"25%;\" style=\"padding: 5px;

Amazon RDS is now being used in mission-critical deployments by tens of thousands of businesses of all sizes. We now process trillions of I/O requests each month for these customers. We're seeing strong adoption in enterprises such as Samsung and <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/solutions/case-studies/unilever.html\">Unilever</a>, web-scale applications like Flipboard and <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/solutions/case-studies/airbnb.html\">Airbnb</a>, and large-scale organizations like <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/solutions/case-studies/nasa-jpl-curiosity.html\">NASA JPL</a> and <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/solutions/case-studies/obama.html\">Obama for America</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Amazon RDS Innovation</b><br>\nWe have added support for three major database engines (MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server), expanded support to all nine of the AWS Regions, and added more than 50 highly requested features. Following is the list of a few key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple database engines: Support for <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/oracle.html\">Oracle </a>and <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/sqlserver.html\">Microsoft SQL Server</a> in addition to <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/mysql.html\">MySQL</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/details/multi-az.html\">Multi-AZ deployments</a>: This feature enables you to create highly available database deployments with synchronous replication across Availability Zones, automatic failure detection, and failover using just a few clicks on the AWS Management Console.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/mysql/#Read_Replica.html\">Read Replicas</a>: This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single database instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can <a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/10/amazon-rds-for-mysql-promote-read-replica.html\">promote</a> a Read Replica to a master as needed and monitor the replication status directly through the AWS Management Console.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/#PIOPS.html\">Provisioned IOPS</a>: Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS is a storage option designed to deliver fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance, and is optimized for I/O-intensive, transactional (OLTP) database workloads. You can provision up to 3TB of storage and 30,000 IOPS per database instance.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/amazon-rds-access-to-database-log-files.html\">Point-and-click access to database logs</a>: You can view and download a variety of database log files to troubleshoot database issues directly using the AWS Management Console.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/relational-database-service-now-with-event-subscriptions.html\">DB Notifications via e-mail and SMS</a>: You can subscribe to receive e-mail or SMS notifications when certain database events such as failover, low storage, replication state change etc. occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These innovations are powering some of the world’s most popular applications that are used by millions of users.</p>\n<p><b>General Availability and Amazon RDS SLA</b><br>\nWe’re officially calling Amazon RDS “Generally Available” after adding several important features as noted above. With the strong level of customer adoption, numerous new features and plenty of operational experience behind us, we also have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Amazon RDS, with 99.95% availability for Multi-AZ database instances on a monthly basis. This SLA is available for Amazon RDS for MySQL and Oracle, which are currently the database engines with Multi-AZ deployment support. If availability falls below 99.95% for your Multi-AZ database instance (which is a maximum of 22 minutes of unavailability for a Multi-AZ database instance per month), you will be eligible to receive service credits. The new Amazon RDS SLA is designed to give you additional confidence to run the most demanding and mission critical workloads dependably in the AWS cloud.

Starting today, you can use Route 53’s existing health checking and DNS failover features for applications running behind an ELB, to increase redundancy and availability for these apps.</p>\n<p>With DNS Failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. When you enable this feature, Route 53 uses health checks—regularly making Internet requests to your application’s endpoints from multiple locations around the world—to determine whether each endpoint of your application is up or down. </p>\n<p>For ELB endpoints, Route 53 evaluates the health of the load balancer itself and the health of your application running on the EC2 instances behind it. If any part of the stack goes down, Route 53 detects the failure, routes traffic away from the load balancer, and directs traffic to other healthy ELB endpoints. Route 53 DNS Failover also supports EC2 endpoints as well as endpoints located in your own datacenter.</p>\n<p>Using Route 53 DNS Failover, you can run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world.

Amazon Elastic Transcoder is a web service that converts your video files into versions that will play back on devices like smartphones, tablets, PCs and web browsers.</p>\n<p>Starting today you can use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to output content in three new ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) support</b> lets you create videos that play on compatible players for Apple iOS, Android devices, set-top boxes and web browsers. With HLS support, you can now easily deliver your content without a streaming server – just point your users to the video in <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon S3</a> or <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront\">Amazon CloudFront</a>.</li>\n \n<li>\n<b>WebM support </b>lets you transcode content into VP8 video and Vorbis audio for playback in browsers, like Firefox, that do not natively support H.264 and AAC.</li>\n \n \n<li>\n<b>MPEG-2 TS output container support</b> lets you output transport streams that are commonly used in broadcast systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We’ve also added four features that make it even easier to use Amazon Elastic Transcoder: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Multiple outputs per job </b>make it easy to create different renditions of the same content. Instead of having to create one transcoding job per rendition, you can now create a single job to produce multiple renditions. For example, with a single job you can create H.264, HLS and WebM versions of the same video for delivery to multiple platforms.</li>\n \n \n \n<li>\n<b>Automatic video bit rate optimization</b> takes the guesswork out of choosing the right bit rate for your video content. With this feature, Amazon Elastic Transcoder will automatically adjust the bit rate in order to optimize the visual quality of your transcoded output.</li>\n \n<li>\n<b>Enhanced aspect ratio and sizing policies</b> make it easier to resize your content to your output frame size. You can use these new settings in transcoding presets to precisely control scaling, cropping, matting and stretching options to get the output that you expect regardless of how the input is formatted.</li>\n \n<li>\n<b>Integration with Amazon S3 permissions and storage options</b> lets you set permissions on your output files from within Amazon Elastic Transcoder. Your files are then created with the right permissions in-place, ready for delivery to end-users. </li>\n \n</ul>\n\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder\">Amazon Elastic Transcoder</a> and these new features by visiting the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder\">detail page</a>.

This represents a fourfold increase from the original Provisioned IOPS volume performance since its launch last year. Provisioned IOPS volumes are designed to provide predictable, high performance for I/O intensive workloads such as databases, distributed file systems and other enterprise applications; all of which are available on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/ref=mkt_ste_wn_PIOPS\"> AWS Marketplace</a>. </p>\n<p> You can get up to 4,000 IOPS from one volume.

We call the newest capability Local Secondary Indexes (LSI).  While DynamoDB already allows you to perform low-latency queries based on your table’s primary key, even at tremendous scale, LSI will now give you the ability to perform fast queries against other attributes (or columns) in your table.  This gives you the ability to perform richer queries while still meeting the low-latency demands of responsive, scalable applications.<br><br>\n\nWith LSI we expand DynamoDB’s existing query capabilities with support for more complex queries.  Customers can now create indexes on non-primary key attributes and quickly retrieve records within a hash partition (i.e., items that share the same hash value in their primary key).<br><br>\n\nThe enhanced query flexibility that local secondary indexes provide means DynamoDB can support an even broader range of workloads.  At Amazon, we have already come to start with DynamoDB as the default choice for every application that does not require the flexibility of relational databases like Oracle or MySQL.  Customers tell us they’re adopting the same practice, particularly in the areas of digital advertising, social gaming and connected device applications where high availability, seamless scalability, predictable performance and low latency are very critical.<br><br>\n\nToday, local secondary indexes must be defined at the time you create your DynamoDB tables.  In the future, we plan to provide you with an ability to add or drop LSI for existing tables.

First, you can provision up to 3 TB in storage and up to 30,000 IOPS for your database instances (maximum realized IOPS will vary by engine type). Second, you can convert an existing <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon RDS</a> instance that uses standard storage to use Provisioned IOPS storage. Finally, you can scale IOPS and storage independently. All three features are enabled for Amazon RDS for MySQL and Oracle database engines. Here are the details:</p>\n<p><b>Provision up to 3TB storage and 30,000 IOPS:</b> You can now provision up to 3TB storage and 30,000 IOPS per database instance – three times the previous limit of 1 TB and 10,000 IOPS per database instance. For a workload with 50% writes and 50% reads running on an m2.4xlarge instance, you can realize up to 25,000 IOPS for Oracle and 12,500 IOPS for MySQL. However, by provisioning up to 30,000 IOPS, you may be able to achieve lower latency and higher throughput. Your actual realized IOPS may vary from the amount you provisioned based on your database workload, instance type, and database engine choice. Refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.ProvisionedIOPS.html#USER_PIOPS.Realized\">Factors That Affect Realized IOPS</a> section of the documentation to learn more.</p>\n<p><b>Convert an existing database instance to use Provisioned IOPS storage:</b> You can now convert database instances using standard storage to use Provisioned IOPS storage and get consistent throughput and low I/O latencies. Use the &quot;Modify&quot; action for your database instance on the DB Instances page of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home\">AWS Management Console</a>, check the &quot;Use Provisioned IOPS&quot; check box, specify the number of IOPS required for your workload, and proceed through the wizard. You can also perform this operation via the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/\">Amazon RDS APIs</a> and the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/CommandLineReference/\">Command Line Interface</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Scale storage and IOPS independently:</b> You can now scale IOPS (in increments of 1000) and storage independently. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to the storage requested (in GB) should be between 3 and 10. For example, for a database instance with 1000 GB of storage, you can provision from 3,000 to 10,000 IOPS. You can scale the IOPS up or down depending on factors such as seasonal variability of traffic to your applications.</p>\n<p>Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS is available in all AWS Regions except GovCloud.

Your task just got easier with Amazon RDS for SQL Server. We are pleased to announce that you can upgrade existing SQL Server 2008 R2 DB Instances to SQL Server 2012 starting today using the new Major Version Upgrade feature. The Major Version Upgrade feature is available in all AWS regions for all SQL Server editions, including Express, Web, Standard, and Enterprise.<br><br>\nWith the Major Version Upgrade feature, you can easily develop and test your applications using the new features Microsoft has introduced as part of SQL Server 2012. In addition, you can upgrade your existing SQL Server 2008 R2 DB Instances and leverage new SQL Server 2012 features with your applications. A few of these new features are highlighted below: <br><ul>\n<li>\n<b>Contained database</b> – a database that is isolated from other SQL Server databases including system databases like the ‘master’ database. This simplifies the task of moving databases from one instance of SQL Server to another by removing dependencies to other SQL Server databases.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Columnstore index</b> – a new type of index for data warehouse type queries. Columnstore indexes can greatly reduce I/O and memory utilization on large queries.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Sequence object</b> – an object that acts as a counter similar to SQL Server’s identity column, but is not restricted to a single table.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>User-defined roles</b> – a new role management system in SQL Server 2012 which allows users to create custom server roles.\n</li>\n</ul>\nUpgrading your DB Instances to SQL Server 2012 is as easy as pushing a button on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon RDS Console</a> or using the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/CommandLineReference/\">Command Line Interface</a>.

SQS API prices will decrease by 50% to $0.50 per million API requests.<br>\n2. SNS API prices will decrease by 17% to $0.50 per million API requests.<br>\n3. The SQS and SNS free tiers will each expand to 1 million free API requests per month, up 10X from 100K requests per month.<br><br>\n\nOur customers constantly discover powerful new ways to build more scalable, elastic and reliable applications using SQS and SNS.  We learned, for example, that some customers use <a href=\"http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/11/efficient-queueing-sqs.html\">SQS as a buffer ahead of their databases and other services</a>.  Other customers <a href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/11/queues-and-notifications-now-best-friends.html\">combine SNS + SQS to fanout/transmit identical messages to multiple queues</a>.<br><br>\n\nOver time, we've optimized our own systems in order to lower costs, and make SQS and SNS available for new customers and new workloads.   Price cuts coupled with SQS features such as long polling (which reduces extraneous polling) and extensions to AmazonSQSAsyncClient (enables easier batching of outgoing messages, and also pre-fetching of incoming messages) give our customers a very cost-effective solution for their messaging needs.  SQS can be even more cost effective for customers that use batching as SQS batches cost the same amount as single messages.<br><br>\n\nWe are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to innovate and drive down our costs.

With DNS Failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. When you enable this feature, Route 53 health-checking agents will monitor each location (or \"endpoint\") of your application to determine its availability. In the event an endpoint fails, Route 53 will route traffic away from the failed endpoint and to other, healthy endpoints. This helps add redundancy to your applications and maintain high availability for your end users.</p>\n<p>You can take advantage of Amazon Route 53’s traffic management capabilities to improve the availability of your applications. For example, if you host your website on Amazon EC2, you can now leverage a simple backup site hosted on Amazon S3. You can also run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world, with Route 53 automatically removing from service any region where your application is unavailable.</p>\n<p>Getting started is easy, and there are no upfront costs.

Global Expansion of Second Generation Standard Instances</b><br>\nLast year, we announced Second Generation Standard (M3) instances.  M3 instances have the same CPU and memory ratio as First Generation Standard (M1) instances but provide more CPU capability, and the option of an instance type with 8 virtual cores.  In this initial launch, M3 instances were only available in the Northern Virginia region, but now you can launch instances as On Demand, Reserved or Spot instances in the Oregon, Northern California, Ireland, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney and GovCloud (US) regions as well.

This capability provides you with the ability to store your application’s primary data in Amazon S3 while retaining frequently accessed data on-premises in the form of a Gateway-Cached volume.  We’re excited to announce that AWS Storage Gateway for EC2 is now in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00AZ4Q6MM\">AWS Marketplace</a>. </p>\n<p>This gives you a cloud-hosted solution that can mirror your entire production environment in case your on-premises infrastructure goes down or if you choose to add additional on-demand compute capacity. You can now make an EBS snapshot copy of a Gateway-Cached volume available to an EC2 instance of your on-premise application using AWS Storage Gateway in EC2.  Using Amazon EC2, you can configure virtual machine images of your application servers in AWS. When you have a DR scenario or you need additional compute capacity, you can launch your application EC2 instances and an AWS Storage Gateway in EC2. You can then restore a snapshot from your on-premises Gateway-Cached volume to a new volume for your AWS Storage Gateway in EC2, connect your EC2 application instances to your restored volume through iSCSI, and your DR or on-demand environment is up and running. You only pay for these servers when you need them, so you can have your DR or on-demand environment at the ready without having to pay for capacity when it’s not in use. </p>\n<p>Learn more and get started by visiting the <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/EC2Gateway.html\">AWS Storage Gateway User Guide</a>.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS Storage Gateway Announces Gateway for Amazon EC2"}

Whether you are an individual developer who uses an Amazon EC2 instance for occasional projects, or an IT professional who manages many Amazon EC2 instances for multiple developers, you can now use Amazon CloudWatch to avoid accumulating unnecessary usage charges.\n</p>\n<p><strong><b>Stop or Terminate EC2 Instances That are Unused or Underutilized</b></strong><br></p>\n\n<p>\nAmazon CloudWatch collects monitoring data for your AWS resources and applications.  Amazon CloudWatch alarms help you react quickly to issues by emailing a notification to you or executing automated tasks when data values reach a threshold you set. Starting today, you can also set alarms that automatically stop or terminate Amazon EC2 instances that have gone unused or underutilized for too long. For example, a student who wants to stay within the AWS Free Usage Tier can set an alarm that automatically stops an instance once it has been left idle for an hour. Or, if you are a corporate IT administrator, you can create a group of alarms that first sends an email notification to developers whose instances have been underutilized for 8 hours, then terminates an instance and emails both of you if utilization doesn't improve after 24 hours.\n</p>\n<p><strong><b>Get Started Using Automated Shutdown Alarms Today</b></strong><br></p>\n\n<p>\nIt's easy to set Amazon CloudWatch alarms that detect and shut down idle Amazon EC2 instances. To get started, first visit Amazon EC2 in the AWS Management Console, select an instance, and click the 'Create Alarm' button in the Monitoring tab that appears in the lower panel. Then, enter an email address to notify, choose 'Stop' or 'Terminate', set a utilization threshold that suits your needs, and you're done. If the threshold is ever reached, Amazon CloudWatch will shut down the instance and email you a notification.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can also set these alarms using the Amazon CloudWatch console, AWS SDKs, Amazon CloudWatch API, and command-line interface.
