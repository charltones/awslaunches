Administrators had to configure an AD Connector directory for each on-premises AD domain that contained user accounts, and in large deployments, administrators might have to configure dozens of AD Connector directories. The AD Connector model also required administrators to distribute links to end users so that the login process goes through the right AD Connector. If a user received the wrong login link, they could not log in, even if they provided the right user name and password. In addition, AD Connector does not support authentication for <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/sqlserver.html\">Amazon RDS SQL Server</a> or other Windows workloads in the AWS Cloud. These constraints made it difficult to configure and administer the use of on-premises AD with AWS applications and Windows workloads in the AWS Cloud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the new interforest trust features, administrators can configure a single trust between Microsoft AD and an on-premises directory to authenticate users for access to AWS applications, and use the same Microsoft AD directory with Amazon RDS SQL Server and Windows workloads. Logging in to AWS applications is easier and less error prone because all users share a single link to each application. For AWS applications such as Amazon QuickSight that integrate with interforest trust authentication, Microsoft AD automatically discovers and routes authentication to the correct domain controller so that end users do not have to remember their domain name.

S3 Object Tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you’ll have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, setup S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics. These object-level tags can then manage transitions between storage classes and expire objects in the background.<br>\n</li>\n<li><b>S3 Analytics, Storage Class Analysis</b> – With storage class analysis, you can analyze storage access patterns and transition the right data to the right storage class. This new S3 Analytics feature automatically identifies the optimal lifecycle policy to transition less frequently accessed storage to SIA. You can configure a storage class analysis policy to monitor an entire bucket, a prefix, or object tag. Once an infrequent access pattern is observed, you can easily create a new lifecycle age policy based on the results. Storage class analysis also provides daily visualizations of your storage usage in the AWS Management Console.

When you create a configuration set, you specify where to publish the email sending metrics (Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon Kinesis Firehose), along with some additional information required by the publishing destination. Then, each time you send an email, you provide the name of the configuration set, tag names, and tag values to apply to the email. Depending on which email sending interface you use, you either provide the tags to Amazon SES as name/value pairs in the API call, or as email headers in the email. As examples of name/value pairs, you could use campaign/book, genre/sci-fi, and generation/millennial when you send an email that advertises science fiction books to your millennial customers.</p>\n<p>You can define your tags and use your email sending metrics for any purpose that helps your business operations and analytics. As an operational metric example, you might publish your email sending metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, and set up an alarm in Amazon CloudWatch to notify you when the complaint rate of your book campaign exceeds 5%. As an example of analytics, you could tag your emails with both a campaign ID and a customer ID, and set up Amazon Kinesis Firehose to stream your email sending metrics to <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/elasticsearch-service/\">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a>.

If you use AWS WAF in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront, you can now update your web access control lists (WebACLs) and IP rulesets to blacklist/whitelist IPv6 address. If you use Amazon Route 53 for your DNS needs, you can create Amazon Route 53 alias records pointing to your Amazon CloudFront distribution to support both IPv4 and IPv6 by using “A” and “AAAA” record type respectively.    <br>\n</p>\n<p>All existing features of Amazon CloudFront will continue to work on IPv6, though there are two changes you may need for internal IPv6 address processing&nbsp;before you turn on IPv6 for your distributions. First,&nbsp;if you have turned on Amazon CloudFront access logs, you will start seeing your viewer’s IPv6 address in the “c-ip” field and may need to verify that your log processing systems continue to work for IPv6.&nbsp;Second, when you enable IPv6 for your Amazon CloudFront distribution, you will get IPv6 addresses in the ‘X-Forwarded-For’ header that is sent to your origins. If your origin systems are only able to process IPv4 addresses, you may need to verify that your origin systems continue to work for IPv6.&nbsp;Additionally, if you use IP whitelists for Trusted Signers, you should use an IPv4-only distribution for your Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelists and an IPv4 / IPv6 distribution for all other content. This model sidesteps an issue that would arise if the signing request arrived over an IPv4 address and was signed as such, only to have the request for the content arrive via a different IPv6 address that is not on the whitelist.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We are enabling IPv6 across&nbsp;every Autonomous System (AS) in a phased rollout starting today and expect to complete rollout across all networks over the next few weeks. To learn more about IPv6 support in Amazon CloudFront, see “<a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloudfront/ipv6\">IPv6 support on Amazon CloudFront</a>” in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide and <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cloudfront/faqs.html\">FAQs</a>.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We would also like to invite you to join the upcoming webinar on “Delivering secure content with Amazon CloudFront”, in which we will cover how Amazon CloudFront automatically meets the new iOS App Transport Secure (ATS) requirements and enables easy, economical SSL/TLS management with the AWS Certificate Manager.

This release follows Amazon S3’s recently added support for IPv6 <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/whats-new/2016/08/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6-support-for-amazon-s3/\">announcement</a>. You can get started using this new feature by enabling Transfer Acceleration on a bucket and then pointing your application to Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration’s                     new “dual-stack” endpoint (e.g., http://&lt;bucketname&gt;.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com), which supports access over both IPv4 and IPv6. In most cases, no further configuration is required for access over IPv6, because most network clients prefer IPv6 addresses by default. However, you must evaluate your bucket and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to ensure that you have the appropriate access configured for your new IPv6 addresses.

With logical replication, we have added support for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/logicaldecoding.html\">logical decoding</a>.&nbsp;You can setup logical replication slots on your instance and stream changes from the database through these slots. A new rds_replication role, assigned to the master user by default, can be used to grant permissions to manipulate and stream data through logical slots and logical replication can be enabled by setting the parameter rds.logical_replication to 1. These logical slots also enable RDS for PostgreSQL to be used as a source for AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). You can learn more about using RDS for PostgreSQL as a source for DMS in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migrate-postgresql-databases-and-perform-ongoing-replication-with-the-aws-database-migration-service/\">AWS Database Blog</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication\">RDS documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Event Triggers:</b></p>\n<p>Amazon RDS now supports the event triggers in PostgreSQL versions 9.4.9 and later and version 9.5.4 and later. The master user account can be used to create, modify, rename, and delete event triggers. Event triggers are at the DB instance level, so they apply to all databases on an instance.

Using Parallel Read Ahead, Aurora performs a parallel pre-fetch of additional relevant pages during a table scan, taking advantage of the replicated storage architecture. This results in range selects, full table scans, the ‘Alter Table’ operation, and index generation performing 5x faster than before. Faster Indexing makes adding indexes and rebuilding tables up to 4x faster. NUMA-Aware scheduling makes CPU-bound operations that make heavy use of the query cache and the buffer cache now run up to 10% faster in large DB instances like db.r3.8xlarge.</p>\n<p>You can take advantage of all these new features today by upgrading your instance to version 1.7 of Amazon Aurora from th <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/\">AWS Management Console</a>.

You will also be able to backup an RDS database into S3 and restore the backup file later onto an on-premises or RDS database. Storing and transferring backup files into and out of AWS through S3 affords customers an added layer of protection for disaster recovery and gives customers a peace of mind that their data can be moved around easily.&nbsp;On RDS, you can encrypt your backup files across SQL Server Express, Web, Standard and Enterprise Editions.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon RDS for SQL Server now supports SQL Server Native Backup/Restore with S3"}

This policy is well suited for updates in production environments where you want to minimize downtime and reduce the risk from failed deployments. It ensures that the impact of a failed deployment is limited to a single instance and allows your application to serve traffic at full capacity throughout the update. The policy deploys code to a single, newly created Amazon EC2 instance and verifies that health checks pass before launching a full set of new instances running the new version. Once the new set of instances running the new application version is launched, the old set of instances is terminated. </p>\n<p>                    You can now also use a rolling with additional batch policy when updating your application. This policy ensures that the impact of a failed deployment is limited to a single batch of instances and allows your application to serve traffic at full capacity throughout the update. The policy deploys code to a single batch of newly created EC2 instances before rolling out the update to your existing instances in equal batches. At the end of the deployment, the last batch of instances running the old application version is terminated. For example, if you have nine EC2 instances running your application and choose to update them in batches of one-third, the policy will first create three new instances running the new version. Once the new batch of instances has passed health checks, Elastic Beanstalk will then update six of the old instances in two separate, successive batches. The three remaining instances running the old version will be terminated. </p>\n<p>                    Additionally, all Linux platforms supported by Elastic Beanstalk have been updated to the 2016.03 Amazon Linux AMI and the number of characters allowed in an environment name has been increased from 23 to 40 characters.</p>\n<p>The use of the new deployment policies requires platform version 2.1.0 or newer.

Using Amazon Route 53’s calculated health check feature, you can also accomplish more sophisticated failover scenarios by combining the results of metric based health checks with the results of standard Amazon Route 53 health checks, which make requests against an endpoint from a network of checkers around the world. For example, you can create a configuration which fails away from an endpoint if either its public-facing web page is unavailable, or if internal metrics such as CPU load, network in/out, or disk reads show that the server itself is unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With <b>DNS Failover for Private Hosted Zones</b>, it is now possible to associate health checks with resource record sets within a Private DNS hosted zone in order to perform failover among multiple endpoints within a VPC. When combined with metric based health checks, you can now configure DNS failover even for endpoints that only have private IP address and thus cannot be reached by standard Amazon Route 53 health checks. With this release, the creation of Alias records pointing to AWS resources is now also fully supported within private DNS hosted zones.</p>\n<p><b>Configurable Health Check Locations</b> enable you to choose the AWS regions from which you would like each of your Amazon Route 53 health checks to be conducted.

This new SDK makes encryption easier for developers while minimizing errors that could lower the security of their applications. Developers using encryption often face two problems: a. how to correctly generate and use a key to encrypt data, and b. how to protect the key after it’s been used. The library provided in the AWS Encryption SDK addresses the first problem by transparently implementing the low-level details using the cryptographic provider available in a developer’s environment. The library addresses the second problem by providing intuitive interfaces to let developers choose how they want to protect their encryption keys after use. By using the AWS Encryption SDK, developers can focus on the core of the application they’re building instead of the complexities of encryption. We’ve provided ready-to-use samples in the SDK for AWS customers who use <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cloudhsm.html\">AWS CloudHSM</a> or <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/kms.html\">AWS Key Management Service</a>, however the open source SDK can be extended to support other key providers.&nbsp;</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS Cryptography announces AWS Encryption SDK"}

Changing engine code can take time and engineering resources away from creating fun gameplay. With the Component Entity system, artists and designers, without engineering experience, can use drag-and-drop interfaces in the Lumberyard Editor to combine components into new game objects, for example animated characters, interactive game elements, props and scenery, and more.</li>\n<li>Allegorithmic’s comprehensive texture and material authoring software, Substance, is now integrated with Lumberyard. Artists can procedurally create and modify 3D asset materials using a visual interface to build beautiful worlds faster than traditional hand-painted methods.</li>\n<li>Another workflow improvement in Lumberyard Beta 1.1 is a new FBX Importer. In a few simple steps, the FBX Importer lets developers import 3D meshes and materials that use the popular .FBX file format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>    Lumberyard Beta 1.1 also introduces mobile support for iOS devices with an A8 or better processor and the Android-based Nvidia Shield. Lumberyard Beta 1.1 uses Apple’s Metal API and leverages their GMEM fast memory to enable high-fidelity iOS visuals. By using Metal and GMEM, Lumberyard enables your game to directly access and push more data to the Apple GPU hardware, so your game can use the latest rendering techniques (e.g. post effects such as depth of field, glow, flares, and color grading)</p>\n<p>  We’ve also added new functionality to Twitch ChatPlay to give game designers new ways to tally viewer votes and query the results to create more complex voting interactions in their games. For example, you could build a game that asks fans watching a tournament to pick their favorite game levels, and then the final round of that tournament could take place in the top three levels.</p>\n<p>  For more full information on this release, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/Lumberyard_Release_Notes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Lumberyard Beta 1.1 release notes</a> for full details.</p>\n<p>  To get started with Amazon Lumberyard, please visit the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/lumberyard.html\">Lumberyard website</a> to download Lumberyard.

Along with those new data, we have added several categories on which you can filter, group, and view your EC2 costs. Specifically, we have added an Instance Type category and separated the EC2 category into EC2 Instances, Elastic Load Balancing (“ELB”), and Elastic Block Store (“EBS”). These additions provide you with the ability to analyze your EC2 costs in greater detail. For example, you can create a Cost Explorer report showing the preceding six months of monthly cost data and filter by “Service: EC2-Instances” to display only costs associated with instance hours (excluding ELB and EBS). You can further refine your filter to include only those costs related to a specific instance type (e.g., m4.large) or group of instance types. Cost Explorer will then display not only the costs associated with those parameters, but also the corresponding usage (EC2 instance hours).<br>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to those EC2-specific feature enhancements, we have added a Region category on which you can filter and/or group your costs for all services (and usage for EC2).<br>\n</p>\n<p>These new categories join a long list on which you are able to filter and group your cost data—across all AWS products—for visual analysis in Cost Explorer, including Service, Account, Tag, Availability Zone (“AZ”), Purchase Option (e.g., reserved), and API Operation.<br>\n</p>\n<p>To get started, navigate to the Cost Explorer page on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home\">Billing and Cost Management console</a>.
