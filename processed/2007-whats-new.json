Amazon DevPay removes the pain of having to create or manage your own order pipeline or billing system. It allows you to quickly sign up customers, automatically meter their usage of AWS services, have Amazon bill them based on any combination of up-front, recurring, or usage-based fees you set, and collect payments. At this stage of the beta, we have limited spots available for developers who would like to charge for their Amazon EC2 AMIs or Amazon S3-based applications; you can learn more and sign up at <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/devpay.html\">http://aws.amazon.com/devpay</a>.

Amazon SimpleDB is a web service for running queries on structured data in real time. This service works in close conjunction with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), collectively providing the ability to store, process and query data sets in the cloud.  Traditionally, this type of functionality has been accomplished with a clustered relational database that requires a sizable upfront investment, brings more complexity than is typically needed, and often requires a DBA to maintain and administer. In contrast, Amazon SimpleDB is easy to use and provides the core functionality of a database – real-time lookup and simple querying of structured data – without the operational complexity. <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/simpledb.html\">Read more</a> about Amazon SimpleDB and sign up to be notified when beta slots are available.</p>","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Amazon SimpleDB (limited beta)"}
