This allows Elastic Beanstalk to provide a more complete picture of application health. You no longer need to manually monitor application metrics (e.g., response latency, CPU, disk space, etc.) to determine if you application is performing as expected. Elastic Beanstalk continuously monitors these on your behalf and changes the environment health status to flag any anomalies.</p>\n<p>As part of Elastic Beanstalk’s enhanced health monitoring features:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health monitoring is near real-time. Elastic Beanstalk evaluates application health and reports metrics approximately every 10 seconds instead of every minute.</li>\n<li>Rolling deployments require health checks to pass before a version deployment to a batch of instances is deemed successful. This ensures that any impact due to regressions in application versions is minimized to a batch of instances.

Many customers use Amazon Kinesis Streams to capture streaming data and load it into Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. Until now, this required customers to manage the Amazon Kinesis data streams and write custom code to load the data. We are now introducing Amazon Kinesis Firehose, a fully managed service that makes this as easy as an API call.</p>\n<p>Amazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into AWS. It can capture and automatically load streaming data into Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the AWS Management Console, configure it with a few clicks, and start sending data to the stream from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded continuously to AWS – all in just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>With Amazon Kinesis Firehose, you only pay for the amount of data you transmit through the service.

Amazon Cognito makes it easy to securely access resources in the AWS Cloud from mobile apps and client-side web apps without hardcoding credentials. Once a user's identity is established, developers can save user-specific data such as game state or user preferences without writing any backend code or managing any infrastructure. The data can be read and saved while offline and synchronized across all of the user's devices. Users can start out using the app as anonymous guests and when they login later their data will be seamlessly transitioned to their authenticated account. With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences without having to worry about building and managing servers to handle user authentication, network state, storage, and sync.</p>\n<p>AWS Cognito is currently available in the US East (N.

Today's price drop continues the AWS tradition of reducing our costs and passing the savings along to our customers. This price reduction will take effect automatically and no action is required on your part.<br>\n<br>\nYou can now choose between three Amazon S3 storage classes that are designed for 99.999999999% durability: Standard, Standard - IA, and Amazon Glacier. Amazon S3 Standard is secure, highly scalable object storage with very low latency, high throughput, and a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.9% availability, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications and workloads that frequently access data such as business applications, dynamic web sites, content distribution, and big data analytics. For data that is less active, but must be immediately accessible when needed, the new Amazon S3 Standard - IA introduces a reduced per GB storage price, with an availability SLA of 99%. For longer-term archiving where immediate access is not required, Amazon Glacier is the lowest cost Amazon S3 storage option, available for as little as $0.007/GB per month.<br>\n<br>\nAmazon S3 also allows you to define configurable lifecycle policies at the bucket level that will automatically move objects to the preferred storage option. For example, you can store data into the Amazon S3 Standard storage class, move it to Standard – IA 30 days after it has been uploaded, and then to Amazon Glacier 60 days later. These transitions happen without any changes to the application, or to the Amazon S3 bucket where the object is stored.<br>\n<br>\nFor more information on today's announcements, read the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-storage-update-new-lower-cost-s3-storage-option-glacier-price-reduction\">AWS blog</a> and visit the <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/s3.html\">Amazon S3 webpage</a>.<br>\n</p>\n","modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:49:35Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2015/09/announcing-new-amazon-s3-storage-class-and-lower-glacier-prices/","postDateTime":"2015-09-16T13:30:00Z","postSummary":"<p>We are excited to announce a new, lower-cost Amazon S3 storage class for data that is accessed less frequently.

A table with interleaved keys arranges your data so each sort key column has equal importance. While <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data.html#t_Sorting_data-compound\">Compound Sort Keys</a> are more performant if you filter on the leading sort key columns, interleaved sort keys provide fast filtering no matter which sort key columns you specify in your WHERE clause. To create an interleaved sort, simply define your sort keys as INTERLEAVED in your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.html\">CREATE TABLE</a> statement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The performance benefit of interleaved sorting increases with table size, and is most effective with highly selective queries that filter on multiple columns. For example, assume your table contains 1,000,000 blocks (1 TB per column) with an interleaved sort key of both customer ID and product ID. You will scan 1,000 blocks when you filter on a specific customer or a specific product, a 1000x increase in query speed compared to the unsorted case. If you filter on both customer and product, you will only need to scan a single block.</p>\n<p>The interleaved sorting feature will be deployed in every region over the next seven days. The new cluster version will be 1.0.921.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For more information, please see our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/quickly-filter-data-in-amazon-redshift-using-interleaved-sorting\">AWS Blog Post on Interleaved Sorting</a> and review our documentation on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_designing-tables-best-practices.html\">Best Practices for Designing Tables</a>.</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Quickly Filter Data in Amazon Redshift using Interleaved Sorting"}

You can now define an access policy directly on a vault, making it easier to grant vault access to users and business groups internal to your organization, as well as to your external business partners.     </p>\n<p>Previously, you have been able to assign AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to IAM users or groups to control the read, write, and delete permissions on your Glacier vaults.  Now, with vault access policies, you can define a single access policy on a vault to govern access to all users.  For example, to protect information in a business-critical vault from unintended deletion, you can create a vault access policy that denies delete attempts from all users.  This data protection procedure can be accomplished in a matter of minutes in the AWS Management Console without having to audit and revoke delete permissions assigned to users through IAM policies.</p>\n<p>Vault access policies also make it easier to grant cross-account access.  For instance, you can grant read-only access on a vault to a business partner in a different AWS account by simply adding that account to the vault’s access policy.  </p>\n<p>To learn more, read the AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/glacier-vault-access-policies/\">blog</a>, and visit <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html\">Getting Started with vault access policies</a>.\t\n</p>\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Introducing Amazon Glacier Vault Access Policies"}

On a database instance running with Amazon RDS encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently so you don’t have to modify your application to access your data. Amazon RDS encryption will work concurrently with Oracle and SQL Server’s Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and running Amazon RDS encryption will not affect TDE. When you create a new SQL Server and Oracle database instance, you can choose to enable encryption via the AWS Management Console or API.
