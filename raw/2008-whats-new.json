Prior to Amazon EBS, storage within an Amazon EC2 instance was tied to the instance itself so that when the instance was terminated, the data within the instance was lost. Now with Amazon EBS, users can choose to allocate storage volumes that persist reliably and independently from Amazon EC2 instances. For even more durable backups, Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots of volumes that are stored to Amazon S3. Amazon EBS is well suited for databases, as well as many other applications that require running a file system or access to raw block-level storage.

These new capabilities allow developers to achieve greater reliability and redundancy for their applications in the cloud, especially hosting websites. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses can be dynamically remapped on the fly to point to any Amazon EC2 instance. Also available is the ability to launch instances in multiple Availability Zones, each with its own reliable, physically independent infrastructure, which allows developers to build fault resilient web applications through simple API calls. \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/ec2.html\"\u003eRead more about these new Amazon EC2 features.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Elastic IP Addresses and Availability Zones for Amazon EC2"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2008","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2008","description":"year#2008","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:48:35+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:48:35+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2008-03-19-announcing-amazon-fulfillment-web-service","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2008/03/19/announcing-amazon-fulfillment-web-service/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:49:46+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T20:57:37+0000","additionalFields":{"modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:47:16Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2008/03/19/announcing-amazon-fulfillment-web-service/","postDateTime":"2008-03-19T20:00:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/fws.html\" title\u003d\"Amazon FWS\"\u003eAmazon Fulfillment Web Service (Amazon FWS)\u003c/a\u003e allows merchants to access Amazon.com’s world-class fulfillment capabilities through a simple web services interface.

Many customers want to be able to use SQS along with our other services (e.g. Amazon EC2, Amazon S3), but need SQS to be less expensive for this to be more feasible. To meet customer needs, we are introducing a new pricing structure that replaces the previous per-messages-sent charge ($0.10/1,000 messages) with a new per-request fee ($0.01/10,000 requests, including all Amazon SQS operations). The net result is that the new pricing will be significantly lower charges for most developers being billed for SQS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe changes are effective as of February 6, 2008 for new customers. For existing Amazon SQS users, you can continue to use the prior version of the service – with the prior pricing – until May 6, 2009.
