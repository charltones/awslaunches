This feature also helps with setting up Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) for your CloudFront distribution - you can configure CloudFront to always add custom headers to your origin to accommodate viewers that don\u0027t automatically include those headers in requests.

The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from all widely used database platforms, such as Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora, and MariaDB. The service supports homogenous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora or SQL Server to MySQL. The AWS Database Migration service can be used to perform one-time migrations, or can maintain continuous replication between databases without a customer having to install or configure any complex software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AWS Schema Conversion Tool, a feature of the AWS Database Migration Service, ports database schemas and stored procedures from one database platform to another, so customers can move their applications from Oracle and SQL Server to Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, and soon PostgreSQL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/dms/pricing.html\"\u003ePricing\u003c/a\u003e for AWS Database Migration Service is low cost.

Many customers use Amazon Kinesis Streams to capture streaming data and load it into Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. Until now, this required customers to manage the Amazon Kinesis data streams and write custom code to load the data. We are now introducing Amazon Kinesis Firehose, a fully managed service that makes this as easy as an API call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into AWS. It can capture and automatically load streaming data into Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the AWS Management Console, configure it with a few clicks, and start sending data to the stream from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be loaded continuously to AWS – all in just a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Amazon Kinesis Firehose, you only pay for the amount of data you transmit through the service.

Amazon S3 Standard is secure, highly scalable object storage with very low latency, high throughput, and a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.9% availability, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications and workloads that frequently access data such as business applications, dynamic web sites, content distribution, and big data analytics. For data that is less active, but must be immediately accessible when needed, the new Amazon S3 Standard - IA introduces a reduced per GB storage price, with an availability SLA of 99%. For longer-term archiving where immediate access is not required, Amazon Glacier is the lowest cost Amazon S3 storage option, available for as little as $0.007/GB per month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAmazon S3 also allows you to define configurable lifecycle policies at the bucket level that will automatically move objects to the preferred storage option. For example, you can store data into the Amazon S3 Standard storage class, move it to Standard – IA 30 days after it has been uploaded, and then to Amazon Glacier 60 days later.

On a database instance running with Amazon RDS encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently so you don’t have to modify your application to access your data. Amazon RDS encryption will work concurrently with Oracle and SQL Server’s Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and running Amazon RDS encryption will not affect TDE. When you create a new SQL Server and Oracle database instance, you can choose to enable encryption via the AWS Management Console or API.

AWS customers use tags to find and organize resources on a single console page using Resource Groups. The new substring search feature lets customers use Resource Groups when their environment uses a single tag key for multiple distinct values, such as “FooDB-Prod-01-jdoe”. For example, create a resource group for a production environment that displays resources with the substring “Prod” anywhere in the “Name” tag.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS Console Resource Groups and Tag Editor Now Support Tag Substring Resource Search"}},"tags":[{"id":"whats-new#general-products#aws-management-console","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#general-products","name":"aws-management-console","description":"general:products/aws-management-console","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T04:46:35+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T04:46:35+0000"},{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2015","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2015","description":"year#2015","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:50:52+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:50:52+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2015-03-amazon-kinesis-client-library-for-nodejs-developers","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2015/03/amazon-kinesis-client-library-for-nodejs-developers/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:56:45+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:08:58+0000","additionalFields":{"postBody":"\u003cp\u003e  Amazon Kinesis team has released Kinesis Client Library (KCL) for Node.js developers.
