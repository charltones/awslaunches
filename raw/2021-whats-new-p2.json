Security analysts can also use Detective to examine a visual summary of inbound and outbound network traffic patterns where the IP has been involved and “drilldown” to explore the traffic details for interactions between the IP address and EC2 instances across covered accounts.

By syncing only the data that the end-user needs, developers can also optimize their app’s network traffic. If you’re building a multi-tenant application, you can choose to sync only data based on a logged-in user’s preference information. The selective sync capability can be reconfigured during runtime on-the-fly in response to events such as a user login or logout.

For example, you have a music streaming application and let users listen to music files in an S3 bucket.

You can further restrict read access to premium music to paid users, by putting the membership attribute in the condition statement in the AWS IAM permissions policy and tag these files with the matching paying member status. Any new users with the matching token issuer and membership attributes will automatically gain access to the S3 bucket and premium music without additional permissions update.

UFCS can be used with all current function types supported in AWS IoT SiteWise — common, comparison, conditional, string, aggregation and temporal functions.

More generally, users can replace functions f(a,b,c...) using the syntax for method chaining as a.f(b,c..) where ‘a’ can be a variable or in itself a function a\u003d f1(x). As a sample customer use case, if a user wants to define a metric that returns the log of a cosine function, log(cos(a)), they can now express it as cos(a).log() using UFCS. AWS IoT SiteWise also supports chaining of if-else functions using UFCS, making it easier to define and trace multiple levels of nested conditional logic. As a generic format, a nested if statement earlier written as:\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style\u003d\"margin-left: 80.0px;\"\u003eif(condition1, on_true_1, if(condition2, on_true_2, on_false_2))\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style\u003d\"margin-left: 40.0px;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ecan now also be written using if-elif nesting under UFCS format as:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style\u003d\"margin-left: 80.0px;\"\u003eif(condition1, on_true_1). elif(condition2, on_true_2, on_false_2)\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, if a renewable energy site operator wants to test if the power output of a solar panel is within a certain range (1-4 kilowatt), they have the flexibility to encode it in two ways- efficiency\u003d if(power.lt(1000),0).elif(power.gt(4000),0,1) using UFCS or if(lt(power, 1000), 0, if(gt(power,4000), 0,1)) using nested functions. In addition, UFCS can be used for method chaining with string operations. For example, a user can detect equipment status in a JSON message as status\u003d contains(lower(jp(message, ‘$.status’)),‘fail’) using nested functions, or status\u003d message.jp(‘$.status’).lower().contains(‘fail’) using the UFCS syntax.
