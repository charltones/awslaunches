In addition, AD Connector does not support authentication for \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds/sqlserver.html\"\u003eAmazon RDS SQL Server\u003c/a\u003e or other Windows workloads in the AWS Cloud. These constraints made it difficult to configure and administer the use of on-premises AD with AWS applications and Windows workloads in the AWS Cloud.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the new interforest trust features, administrators can configure a single trust between Microsoft AD and an on-premises directory to authenticate users for access to AWS applications, and use the same Microsoft AD directory with Amazon RDS SQL Server and Windows workloads. Logging in to AWS applications is easier and less error prone because all users share a single link to each application. For AWS applications such as Amazon QuickSight that integrate with interforest trust authentication, Microsoft AD automatically discovers and routes authentication to the correct domain controller so that end users do not have to remember their domain name. Interforest trust login reduces the number of endpoints to configure, reduces the number of links to distribute, simplifies the login process for end users, and allows you to use the same directory to support AWS applications and Windows workloads in the AWS Cloud.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo take advantage of interforest trust login, AWS applications require an update to provision on-premises users through the Microsoft AD interforest trust.

IPv6 will be enabled by default for all newly created Amazon CloudFront web distributions starting today. For existing web distributions, you can enable IPv6 through the Amazon CloudFront console or API.

First,\u0026nbsp;if you have turned on Amazon CloudFront access logs, you will start seeing your viewer’s IPv6 address in the “c-ip” field and may need to verify that your log processing systems continue to work for IPv6.\u0026nbsp;Second, when you enable IPv6 for your Amazon CloudFront distribution, you will get IPv6 addresses in the ‘X-Forwarded-For’ header that is sent to your origins. If your origin systems are only able to process IPv4 addresses, you may need to verify that your origin systems continue to work for IPv6.\u0026nbsp;Additionally, if you use IP whitelists for Trusted Signers, you should use an IPv4-only distribution for your Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelists and an IPv4 / IPv6 distribution for all other content. This model sidesteps an issue that would arise if the signing request arrived over an IPv4 address and was signed as such, only to have the request for the content arrive via a different IPv6 address that is not on the whitelist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are enabling IPv6 across\u0026nbsp;every Autonomous System (AS) in a phased rollout starting today and expect to complete rollout across all networks over the next few weeks.

Now, with JITR you can complete the second step by auto-registering device certificates when devices connect to AWS IoT for the first time.

It ensures that the impact of a failed deployment is limited to a single instance and allows your application to serve traffic at full capacity throughout the update. The policy deploys code to a single, newly created Amazon EC2 instance and verifies that health checks pass before launching a full set of new instances running the new version.

The policy deploys code to a single batch of newly created EC2 instances before rolling out the update to your existing instances in equal batches. At the end of the deployment, the last batch of instances running the old application version is terminated. For example, if you have nine EC2 instances running your application and choose to update them in batches of one-third, the policy will first create three new instances running the new version.

This new SDK makes encryption easier for developers while minimizing errors that could lower the security of their applications. Developers using encryption often face two problems: a. how to correctly generate and use a key to encrypt data, and b. how to protect the key after it’s been used. The library provided in the AWS Encryption SDK addresses the first problem by transparently implementing the low-level details using the cryptographic provider available in a developer’s environment. The library addresses the second problem by providing intuitive interfaces to let developers choose how they want to protect their encryption keys after use. By using the AWS Encryption SDK, developers can focus on the core of the application they’re building instead of the complexities of encryption.

If a multipart upload is not completed, the partial upload does not appear when you list your objects by default, but does incur storage charges. Previously, you needed to manually cancel the multipart upload to remove partial uploads. Starting today, you can set a lifecycle policy to automatically expire incomplete multipart uploads after a predefined number of days.

While you are not charged for storing delete markers, removing expired markers can improve performance for list requests on your bucket.
