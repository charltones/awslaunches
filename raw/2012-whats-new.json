You can now convert a MySQL Read Replica into a “standalone” DB Instance using the “Promote Read Replica” option. This option stops replication and converts the Read Replica in its existing state into a “standalone” DB Instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use this option for a number of use cases including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cb\u003ePerform DDL operations\u003c/b\u003e: DDL operations such as creating/re-building indexes etc. could take a long time and impose significant performance penalty on your DB Instance.

Common ways to split a database are: Splitting tables that are not joined in the same query onto different hosts or duplicating a table across multiple hosts and then deciding on a hashing algorithm to figure out into which host a row goes. You can create Read Replicas corresponding to each of your “shards” and promote them when you decide to convert them into “standalone” shards.

With the ability to “Promote“, Read Replica can potentially be considered as an additional recovery alternative against failures. However, it is to be noted that with asynchronous replication, database writes occur on a Read Replica after they have already occurred on the Source DB Instance, and this replication “lag” can vary significantly depending on the workload.

To use this feature, you specify whether you want Amazon CloudFront to forward some or all of your cookies to your custom origin server. Amazon CloudFront then considers the forwarded cookie values when identifying a unique object in its cache. This way, your end users get both the benefit of content that is personalized just for them with a cookie and the performance benefits of Amazon CloudFront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, starting today you have a new option to lower the prices you pay to deliver content out of Amazon CloudFront. By default, Amazon CloudFront minimizes end user latency by delivering content from its entire global network of edge locations. However, because we charge more where our costs are higher, this means that you pay more to deliver your content with low latency to end-users in some locations. While this is the right choice for most Amazon CloudFront customers, we heard that for some use cases cost is a more important concern than latency. So, starting today we’re giving you the option to exclude the more expensive Amazon CloudFront locations from your distributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, nothing changes: your existing distributions will continue to use the entire network of edge locations. However, if you wish, you can use the AWS Management Console or the Amazon CloudFront API to specify whether you want to deliver content only through a subset of edge locations (we call each subset a price class) where our prices are lower. Note, if you select a price class that does not include all locations, you’ll pay less, but your end users who would normally be served by the locations you exclude will experience higher latency than if your content was being served from all Amazon CloudFront locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we have added three new fields to your Amazon CloudFront access logs:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe result type of each HTTP(s) request (for example, cache hit/miss/error).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe cookie header in the request (if any).

Until now, you needed to run a custom proxy server between your web application and Amazon S3 to support these capabilities.

You can then set the TTL for each file by setting the cache control header on your file in the origin. Amazon CloudFront uses cache control headers to determine how frequently each edge location gets an updated version of the file from the origin. Note that our default behavior isn’t changing; if no cache control header is set, each edge location will continue to use an expiration period of 24 hours before checking the origin for changes to that file.
