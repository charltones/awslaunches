Using custom internal DNS names (rather than IP addresses or AWS-provided names such as ec2-10-1-2-3.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) has a variety of benefits, for example, being able to flip from one database to another just by changing the mapping of a domain name such as internal.example.com to point to a new IP address. Route 53 also supports split-view DNS, so you can configure public and private hosted zones to return different external and internal IP addresses for the same domain names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e  To learn more, visit the \u003ca adhocenable\u003d\"false\" href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/route53.html\"\u003eRoute 53 product page\u003c/a\u003e for full details and pricing, or see our \u003ca adhocenable\u003d\"false\" href\u003d\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003edocumentation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:48:50Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2014/11/05/amazon-route-53-now-supports-private-dns-with-amazon-vpc/","postDateTime":"2014-11-05T14:24:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can now use Amazon Route 53, AWS\u0027s highly available and scalable DNS service, to easily manage your internal domain names with the same simplicity, security, and cost effectiveness that Route 53 already provides for external DNS names.

These APIs are designed to help developers write more intuitive and resource-oriented code for working with AWS services. AWS resources such as EC2 instances and S3 objects are exposed as Ruby objects, with attributes that are automatically loaded from the service when accessed for the first time, and methods that map to various actions available for the resource objects. Improved from similar concepts that exist in the Version 1 of the SDK, the new APIs introduce a number of improvements including easier control over underlying network calls, model-driven resource classes, and resource waiters. While the request-response APIs available in the aws-sdk-core gem allow explicit and granular control over the network calls your application makes to AWS, using the new resource APIs can help you simplify your code and reduce development time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Developer Preview - Resource APIs for Version 2 of AWS SDK for Ruby"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2014","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2014","description":"year#2014","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:50:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:50:27+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2014-09-24-welcome-first-aws-community-heroes","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2014/09/24/welcome-first-aws-community-heroes/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:51:55+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:03:24+0000","additionalFields":{"modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:48:39Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2014/09/24/welcome-first-aws-community-heroes/","postDateTime":"2014-09-24T11:47:14Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003eAWS is comprised of users whose enthusiasm has created a vibrant community worldwide.

Geo DNS also lets you balance load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, ensuring that each end-user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint. Geo DNS provides three levels of geographic granularity: continent, country, and state, and Geo DNS also provides a global record which is served in cases where an end user\u0027s location doesn\u0027t match any of the specific Geo DNS records you have created. You can also combine Geo DNS with other routing types, such as Latency Based Routing and DNS Failover, using Route 53\u0027s Alias feature in order to enable a variety of low-latency and fault-tolerant architectures  To learn more, please see the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo\"\u003eRoute 53 documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eLower Prices for DNS Queries\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffective August 1, we are lowering Route 53 prices for both Standard Queries and Latency Based Routing Queries by 20%.

Previously, to update a health check you had to delete the existing health check and create a new one with the desired changes.

You can also add a \"Name\" tag to any of your existing health checks. The \"Name\" tag appears in the Route 53 console when you associate a health check with a resource record set.

To get started with this feature, you simply include caption data with each video in your transcoding job. You may transcode embedded broadcast caption formats such as CEA-608 to newer formats such as WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) to reach modern internet enabled devices. You may also supply a separate sidecar file (a stand-alone file containing only captions) along with the original caption file to add support for a language that was not included in the original video. Finally, you may include an output DFXP caption file (which is compatible with the SMPTE-TT standard) to prepare content that complies with FCC rules that require captioning support for programs re-shown on the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no additional costs for using Captioning Support with Amazon Elastic Transcoder beyond the normal usage fees for the service.

General Purpose (SSD) volumes offer the same five nines of availability and durable snapshot capabilities as other volume types. Pricing and performance for General Purpose (SSD) volumes are simple and predictable. You pay for each GB of storage you provision, and there are no additional charges for I/O performed on a volume.

Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance, are designed for I/O-intensive applications such as large relational or \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/nosql.html\"\u003eNoSQL databases\u003c/a\u003e, and allow you to choose the level of performance you need.

However, by provisioning up to 30,000 IOPS, you may be able to achieve lower latency and higher throughput. For SQL Server you can provision up to 10,000 IOPS and 1 TB of allocated storage.

However, in some cases, your end users may be using DNS resolvers that are far from their geographic location and in those cases, end user requests may be routed to an Amazon CloudFront edge location that isn’t optimal for your end user. By supporting EDNS-Client-Subnet, Amazon CloudFront can now route requests to the optimal edge location by looking at a truncated version of the end user’s IP address added into the DNS request. Today, Google Public DNS and Open DNS are two providers that include this truncated IP address (specifically, the first three octets) of the end user in the DNS request.
