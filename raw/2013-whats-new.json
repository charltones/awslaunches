This meant that you could experience situations where some instances would receive a disproportionally higher amount of inbound requests than others because clients were incorrectly caching DNS information.  In addition, if you did not have an equal number of healthy instances in each of the Availability Zones (e.g. if you had taken some instances down for maintenance), your requests would be balanced across a smaller number of healthy back-end instances in the affected Availability Zones – meaning that you would have to closely monitor and adjust your back-end instance capacity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you enable cross-zone load balancing, you no longer have to worry that clients caching DNS information will result in requests being distributed unevenly.

With Amazon VPC, you can define a virtual network topology and customize the network configuration to closely resemble a traditional network that you might operate in your own datacenter. This release lets you take advantage of the application management benefits of AWS OpsWorks in your own isolated network to support common scenarios such as using a private source repository behind your firewall, running databases in a protected subnet, or using application servers in a private subnet behind a public load balancer. All it takes to get started is to create an AWS OpsWorks stack using a new or existing Amazon VPC. You can then create OpsWorks instances in any subnet that you have created. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about how to use AWS OpsWorks with Amazon VPC, see the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-vpc.html\"\u003edocumentation for a step-by-step example\u003c/a\u003e or join our \u003ca href\u003d\"http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e\u003d672406\u0026amp;s\u003d1\u0026amp;k\u003dC50030EE167CB6996D43C6859465B73D\"\u003eAWS OpsWorks webinar on September 12, 2013 at 10:00 AM PT\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS OpsWorks announces support for Amazon VPC"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2013","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2013","description":"year#2013","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:49:57+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:49:57+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2013-09-03-announcing-aws-cli-ga","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2013/09/03/announcing-aws-cli-ga/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:53:08+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:09:31+0000","additionalFields":{"modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:48:02Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2013/09/03/announcing-aws-cli-ga/","postDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:00:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003eWe are pleased to announce the General Availability (GA) release of the \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/cli.html\"\u003eAWS Command Line Interface\u003c/a\u003e, a unified tool to manage your AWS services.

When taking a database snapshot of a Single-AZ master instance, you may experience a brief I/O suspension. Taking a database snapshot from a Read Replica instead, can help you mitigate this brief performance impact. However, please note that the database snapshots taken from a Read Replica at a given time may not include all the transactions present on the master at that time because of possible replica lag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCreate a replica from an existing Read Replica\u003c/b\u003e \u003cb\u003e(supported for MySQL 5.6)\u003c/b\u003e - You can now create a second-tier Read Replica from an existing first-tier Read Replica. By creating a second-tier Read Replica, you may be able to move some of the replication load from the master database instance to a first-tier Read Replica.

Today, we are excited to announce two more features – Custom SSL Certificates and zone apex support – that make it easier for you to accelerate and deliver your whole website using Amazon CloudFront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCustom SSL Certificate support lets you deliver content over HTTPS using your own domain name and your own SSL certificate. This helps give visitors to your website lower latency and higher reliability along with the security benefits of CloudFront over an SSL connection that uses your own domain name. You can also configure CloudFront to use HTTPS connections for origin fetches so that your data is encrypted end-to-end from your origin to your end users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfiguring Custom SSL Certificate support is easy; you don’t need to learn any proprietary code or hire any consultants to configure it for you. Starting today, you can sign up for an invitation to use the Custom SSL Certificate feature by filling out the form on the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains\"\u003ecustom SSL certificate feature page\u003c/a\u003e. As soon as we approve your request, you can upload your SSL certificate and use the AWS Management Console to associate it with your CloudFront distributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePricing for Custom SSL Certificates is simple. We charge a fixed monthly fee for each custom SSL certificate you associate with your CloudFront distributions, pro-rated by the hour. As with other CloudFront features, you pay only for what you use and there are no upfront fees or minimum monthly commitments. You can learn more about Custom SSL Certificates by reading the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/SecureConnections.html#CNAMEsAndHTTPS\"\u003eAmazon CloudFront Developer Guide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, starting today you can now use Amazon CloudFront to deliver content from the root domain, or \u0026quot;zone apex\u0026quot; of your website. For example, you can now configure both http://www.example.com and http://example.com to point at the same CloudFront distribution, without the performance penalty or availability risk of managing a redirect service. To use this feature, you create an Amazon Route 53 Alias record to map the root of your domain to your CloudFront distribution. There are no extra fees from Route 53, as Alias queries that are mapped to a CloudFront distribution are provided free of charge.

This SLA is available for Amazon RDS for MySQL and Oracle, which are currently the database engines with Multi-AZ deployment support. If availability falls below 99.95% for your Multi-AZ database instance (which is a maximum of 22 minutes of unavailability for a Multi-AZ database instance per month), you will be eligible to receive service credits.

We call the newest capability Local Secondary Indexes (LSI).  While DynamoDB already allows you to perform low-latency queries based on your table’s primary key, even at tremendous scale, LSI will now give you the ability to perform fast queries against other attributes (or columns) in your table.  This gives you the ability to perform richer queries while still meeting the low-latency demands of responsive, scalable applications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith LSI we expand DynamoDB’s existing query capabilities with support for more complex queries.  Customers can now create indexes on non-primary key attributes and quickly retrieve records within a hash partition (i.e., items that share the same hash value in their primary key).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe enhanced query flexibility that local secondary indexes provide means DynamoDB can support an even broader range of workloads.  At Amazon, we have already come to start with DynamoDB as the default choice for every application that does not require the flexibility of relational databases like Oracle or MySQL.  Customers tell us they’re adopting the same practice, particularly in the areas of digital advertising, social gaming and connected device applications where high availability, seamless scalability, predictable performance and low latency are very critical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday, local secondary indexes must be defined at the time you create your DynamoDB tables.  In the future, we plan to provide you with an ability to add or drop LSI for existing tables.  If you want to equip an existing DynamoDB table to local secondary indexes immediately, you can \u003ca href\u003d\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/EMRforDynamoDB.html\"\u003eexport the data from your existing table using Elastic Map Reduce\u003c/a\u003e, and import it to a new table with LSI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLocal secondary indexes are available today in all regions except GovCloud.

Other customers \u003ca href\u003d\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/11/queues-and-notifications-now-best-friends.html\"\u003ecombine SNS + SQS to fanout/transmit identical messages to multiple queues\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver time, we\u0027ve optimized our own systems in order to lower costs, and make SQS and SNS available for new customers and new workloads.   Price cuts coupled with SQS features such as long polling (which reduces extraneous polling) and extensions to AmazonSQSAsyncClient (enables easier batching of outgoing messages, and also pre-fetching of incoming messages) give our customers a very cost-effective solution for their messaging needs.  SQS can be even more cost effective for customers that use batching as SQS batches cost the same amount as single messages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to innovate and drive down our costs.

With DNS Failover, Amazon Route 53 can help detect an outage of your website and redirect your end users to alternate locations where your application is operating properly. When you enable this feature, Route 53 health-checking agents will monitor each location (or \"endpoint\") of your application to determine its availability. In the event an endpoint fails, Route 53 will route traffic away from the failed endpoint and to other, healthy endpoints. This helps add redundancy to your applications and maintain high availability for your end users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can take advantage of Amazon Route 53’s traffic management capabilities to improve the availability of your applications. For example, if you host your website on Amazon EC2, you can now leverage a simple backup site hosted on Amazon S3. You can also run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world, with Route 53 automatically removing from service any region where your application is unavailable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting started is easy, and there are no upfront costs.

You only pay for these servers when you need them, so you can have your DR or on-demand environment at the ready without having to pay for capacity when it’s not in use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more and get started by visiting the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/EC2Gateway.html\"\u003eAWS Storage Gateway User Guide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"AWS Storage Gateway Announces Gateway for Amazon EC2"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2013","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2013","description":"year#2013","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:49:57+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:49:57+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2013-01-14-amazon-rds-now-provides-ability-to-rename-database-instances","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2013/01/14/amazon-rds-now-provides-ability-to-rename-database-instances/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:50:38+0000","dateUpdated":"2021-04-29T04:31:36+0000","additionalFields":{"modifiedDate":"2021-04-29T04:30:43Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2013/01/14/amazon-rds-now-provides-ability-to-rename-database-instances/","postDateTime":"2013-01-14T20:00:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003eWe are pleased to announce a new feature that enables you to rename an existing database instance.
