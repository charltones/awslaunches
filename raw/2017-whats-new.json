This simplifies building APIs that support Cognito Oauth2 scopes by removing the need to create an AWS Lambda function that performs the authorization. A scope defines the level of access to a resource that an application has permission to. For example, if you have a resource server for storing photos, you could define two scopes: one for read access to the photos and one for write/delete access. You can require applications to request access to your APIs by including a token with one or more scopes embedded inside it.

All these web applications use SSL/TLS encryption between the end user and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and your origin.

For instance, an e-commerce site could collect the purchaser’s credit card number as well as their shipping address to process an order. These orders may be processed by a payment micro-service as well as an order fulfillment service in the application layer. The order fulfillment service doesn\u0027t need access to credit card numbers. With field-level encryption, CloudFront’s edge locations can encrypt the credit card data. From that point on, only applications that have the private keys can decrypt the sensitive fields.

Sumerian makes it easy to create all the building blocks needed to build highly immersive and interactive 3D experiences including adding objects (e.g. characters, furniture, and landscape), and designing, animating, and scripting environments. Sumerian does not require specialized expertise and you can design scenes directly from your browser.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Amazon Sumerian (Preview)"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2017","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2017","description":"year#2017","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#general-products#amazon-sumerian","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#general-products","name":"amazon-sumerian","description":"general:products/amazon-sumerian","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:10:40+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:10:40+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2017-11-introducing-aws-elemental-mediatailor","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-aws-elemental-mediatailor/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T06:02:09+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:13:35+0000","additionalFields":{"postBody":"\u003cp\u003eThis service functions independently or as part of AWS Media Services, a family of services that form the foundation of cloud-based video workflows and offer customers the capabilities they need to create, package, and deliver video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAWS Elemental MediaTailor is available in the US East (Virginia), and EU (Ireland) regions.

Certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet. Before issuing a certificate for your site, Amazon must validate that you own or control the domain name for your site. Previously ACM supported only email validation, which required the domain owner to receive an email for each certificate request and validate the information in the request before approving it. With DNS validation, you simply write a CNAME record to your DNS configuration to establish ownership or control of your domain name. The ACM management console can configure the DNS records for you if you manage your DNS records with Amazon Route 53. This makes it easy to validate your domain with a few mouse clicks. Once the CNAME record is configured, ACM can automatically renew DNS-validated certificates that are in use (associated with other AWS resources) before they expire, as long as the DNS record remains in place.

Auto Scaling helps you build systems that respond to changes in demand by automatically launching or terminating Amazon EC2 instances based on conditions that you define. This dynamic scaling helps to improve application availability and reduce costs. For example, you can use Auto Scaling to automatically launch EC2 instances for your Auto Scaling group when demand increases to help maintain performance, and terminate instances when demand drops to save money.\u003c/p\u003e\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Introducing Target Tracking Scaling Policies for Auto Scaling"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#general-products#auto-scaling","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#general-products","name":"auto-scaling","description":"general:products/auto-scaling","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:02:50+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:02:50+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2017","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2017","description":"year#2017","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2017-07-aws-device-farm-announces-enhanced-jenkins-support-for-web-applications-testing-and-additional-features","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/aws-device-farm-announces-enhanced-jenkins-support-for-web-applications-testing-and-additional-features/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T06:03:25+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:08:53+0000","additionalFields":{"postBody":"\u003cp\u003e                 With this latest release, AWS Device Farm enables testing of Web Applications in addition to native and hybrid mobile applications, providing significant improvement in efficiencies for development teams to test all of their apps with one infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e                 In addition, this release allows developers to select the Appium test framework version when scheduling a test.

Parameters can still individually be deleted or set to IAM policies, but now you can also perform these actions in bulk by specifying hierarchy paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e                 Parameters can now also be tagged, allowing you to easily categorize, filter, and control access depending on your business or IT needs. Tagging can be used with IAM policies to increase the control and security of parameters. For example, production passwords can be tagged and an IAM policy can be created that restricts access to only list the parameters, not the values. This creates a dynamic IAM policy depending on which parameters are included in the tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, notifications and events can now be triggered based on the state of the parameter. You can receive an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) alert when a parameter is updated, deleted, or accessed. Through Amazon CloudWatch Events, a change to a parameter could initiate an AWS Lambda function, such as when you want to reset database connections when a password is updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e                 Systems Manager is available in \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services.html\"\u003eall regions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e                 For more information about Systems Manager Parameter Store, visit our \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/ec2/systems-manager/parameter-store/\"\u003eProduct Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:53:04Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/amazon-ec2-systems-manager-adds-hierarchy-tagging-and-notification-support-for-parameter-store/","postDateTime":"2017-06-22T15:30:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003e                 Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports parameter hierarchy, tagging, and notifications, available through the Parameter Store capability.\u003c/p\u003e\n","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Adds Hierarchy, Tagging, and Notification Support for Parameter Store"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#general-products#amazon-ec2-systems-manager","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#general-products","name":"amazon-ec2-systems-manager","description":"general:products/amazon-ec2-systems-manager","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T04:26:13+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T04:26:13+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2017","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2017","description":"year#2017","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:54:09+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2017-06-aws-codepipeline-adds-ability-to-view-history-of-pipeline","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/aws-codepipeline-adds-ability-to-view-history-of-pipeline/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:57:42+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:06:24+0000","additionalFields":{"postBody":"\u003cp\u003eThe AWS CodePipeline console will now provide you with change details associated with each execution.

For example, suppose you manage an HTTP web service with a dozen web servers that each have their own IP address. No one web server could handle all of the traffic, but if you create a dozen multivalue answer records, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records in response to each DNS query. Amazon Route 53 gives different answers to different DNS resolvers. If a web server becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software can try another IP address in the response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can create multivalue answer records programmatically, using the Amazon Route 53 API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.

AWS Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.

This new SDK joins the Java version launched in 2016 to make encryption easier for developers while minimizing errors that could lower the security of their applications. Developers using encryption often face two problems: a. how to correctly generate and use a key to encrypt data, and b. how to protect the key after it’s been used. The AWS Encryption SDK addresses the first problem by transparently implementing the low-level details using the cryptographic provider available in a developer’s environment. The SDK addresses the second problem by providing intuitive interfaces to let developers choose how they want to protect their encryption keys after use. By using the AWS Encryption SDK, developers can focus on the core of the application they’re building instead of the complexities of encryption.

Let’s say you own an m4.2xlarge Linux/UNIX regional RI in US East (N.Virginia). The discounted rate of this RI can automatically apply to 2 m4.xlarge instances in us-east-1a or 4 m4.large instances in us-east-1b without you needing to do anything. Since the discounted rate is automatically applied to usage irrespective of size or AZ, you can save even more off your EC2 bill with no management overhead of trying to match RI discounts to running instances. With the instance size flexibility and AZ flexibility provided by regional RIs, customers no longer have to worry about being tied to a specific size or AZ, or worry about launching the right instance size in the right AZ to match their RIs. This helps you save time and money, and lets you focus on the performance and needs of your application.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstance size flexibility is offered on Linux/UNIX regional RIs and is available at no additional cost.

Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function lets you scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application. Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. This makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected.

The Quick Start was created by AWS in partnership with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.splunk.com/\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eSplunk, Inc.\u003c/a\u003e, to integrate solutions and services from both companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation templates to automatically deploy Splunk Enterprise into your AWS account. It uses the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Splunk Enterprise running on Amazon Linux to set up EC2 instances that include the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n• Splunk indexing cluster, with the number of indexers you specify (3-10)\u003cbr\u003e\n• Splunk stand-alone or clustered search heads\u003cbr\u003e\n• Splunk license server and index cluster master\u003cbr\u003e\n• Splunk search head deployer, where applicable\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Quick Start provides two deployment options to support test, POC, or production environments: You can either build a new, Multi-AZ AWS environment with a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets, and other infrastructure components for Splunk Enterprise, or you can deploy Splunk Enterprise into your existing Multi-AZ AWS environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Quick Start includes a deployment guide, which describes the reference architecture, provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Splunk Enterprise on AWS, and discusses configuration settings and best practices.
