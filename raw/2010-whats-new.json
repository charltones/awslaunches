It is designed to give developers and businesses a reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating human readable names like \u003ci\u003ewww.example.com\u003c/i\u003e into the numeric IP addresses like \u003ci\u003e192.0.2.1\u003c/i\u003e that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in Amazon Web Services (AWS) – such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWith Route 53, you can create a “hosted zone” to add DNS records for a new domain or transfer DNS records for a domain you currently own. Route 53 is also designed to work well with other AWS offerings, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). By using AWS IAM with Route 53, you can control who in your organization can make changes to your DNS records. In the future, we plan to add additional integration features such as the ability to automatically tie your Amazon Elastic Load Balancer instances to a DNS name, and the ability to route your customers to the closest EC2 region.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRoute 53 is also designed to be fast and simple. It uses a global network of DNS servers to respond to end users with low latency and has an easy-to-use, self-service API. There are no long-term contracts or minimum usage commitments for using Route 53 – you pay $1.00 per month for the hosted zones you manage, $0.50 per million queries for the first billion queries, and $0.25 per million queries above a billion.

First, we’ve added the ability to deliver content over an HTTPS connection. Since we launched Amazon CloudFront, HTTPS support has been one of the most requested features by our customers. HTTPS lets you transfer content over an encrypted connection, helping ensure the authenticity of the content delivered to your users. Amazon CloudFront HTTPS delivery can be used to transfer inherently sensitive objects to your users, to avoid security warnings that some browsers present when viewing a mix of HTTP and HTTPS content, or for anything else that needs to be encrypted when transferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing HTTPS is easy – just change your cloudfront.net links to use https:// instead of http://, and Amazon CloudFront will serve your content using HTTPS. By default, Amazon CloudFront will accept requests over both the HTTP and the HTTPS protocols. However, if you always want your content encrypted when transmitted, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to require HTTPS for all requests for your content and not allow requests made over the regular HTTP protocol. For HTTPS requests, Amazon CloudFront will also use HTTPS to retrieve your object from Amazon S3, so your object is encrypted whenever it is transmitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePricing for HTTPS requests start at $0.01 per 10,000 requests. As always, you will pay only for what you actually use with the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re also announcing today that we’ve reduced our pricing for regular HTTP requests by 25%: prices for HTTP requests now start at $0.0075 per 10,000 requests, letting you save on content that doesn’t require HTTPS. We’re always looking for ways to reduce our costs, and we’re happy that we can pass these savings on to our customers. These lower prices will apply for all usage starting on June 1, 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we wanted to let you know that we’ve opened a new edge location in New York City, adding to our existing US East Coast locations.

It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications.  It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazon SNS provides a simple web services interface that can be used to create topics you want to notify applications (or people) about, subscribe clients to these topics, publish messages, and have these messages delivered over clients’ protocol of choice (i.e. HTTP, email, etc.).  Amazon SNS delivers notifications to clients using a “push” mechanism that eliminates the need to periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates.   Amazon SNS can be leveraged to build highly reliable, event-driven workflows and messaging applications without the need for complex middleware and application management. The potential uses for Amazon SNS include monitoring applications, workflow systems, time-sensitive information updates, mobile applications, and many others. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments required, and you pay only for the resources you use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more about the Amazon SNS at: \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/sns.html\"\u003ehttp://aws.amazon.com/sns\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","contentType":"Launch Announcement","headline":"Announcing Amazon Simple Notification Service"}},"tags":[{"id":"GLOBAL#content-type#launch-announcement","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"GLOBAL#content-type","name":"Launch Announcement","description":"Launch Announcement","createdBy":"jenbar","lastUpdatedBy":"jenbar","dateCreated":"2020-04-29T05:19:27+0000","dateUpdated":"2022-02-03T03:31:08+0000"},{"id":"whats-new#year#2010","locale":"en_US","tagNamespaceId":"whats-new#year","name":"2010","description":"year#2010","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:49:06+0000","dateUpdated":"2019-05-03T05:49:06+0000"}]},{"item":{"id":"whats-new#about-aws-whats-new-2010-04-01-announcing-combined-aws-data-transfer-pricing","locale":"en_US","directoryId":"whats-new","name":"/about-aws/whats-new/2010/04/01/announcing-combined-aws-data-transfer-pricing/","author":"aws","createdBy":"aws","lastUpdatedBy":"aws","numImpressions":0,"score":0.0,"dateCreated":"2019-05-03T05:49:57+0000","dateUpdated":"2020-12-30T21:06:46+0000","additionalFields":{"modifiedDate":"2019-10-06T04:47:11Z","headlineUrl":"/about-aws/whats-new/2010/04/01/announcing-combined-aws-data-transfer-pricing/","postDateTime":"2010-04-01T20:00:00Z","postSummary":"\u003cp\u003eStarting April 1, 2010, your Data Transfer Out pricing tier for a given Region will be based on your total Data Transfer Out usage within that region for \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/s3.html\"\u003eAmazon S3\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/ec2.html\"\u003eAmazon EC2\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/simpledb.html\"\u003eAmazon SimpleDB\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/rds.html\"\u003eAmazon RDS\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/sqs.html\"\u003eAmazon SQS\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/vpc.html\"\u003eAmazon VPC\u003c/a\u003e.
